France,Alsace,Domaine Bott-Geyl 2012 Galets Oligocène Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,90,33.0,"The Pinot-ness of this wine is undeniable: its structure is of velvet, and its aromas convey freshly turned earth, autumnal oak leaf and subdued red-cherry fruit. There is a depth that evokes deep forests. Have this with furred or feathered game."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Collotte 2014 Clos de Jeu  (Marsannay),Pinot Noir,90,,"With tannins and new-wood flavors, this rich wine is also structured.

France,France Other,Clos Teddi 2007 Rosé Red (Patrimonio),Red Blend,85,25.0,"For those with a classical bent, Clos Teddi is named after Thetis, sea goddess and mother of Achilles. This rosé, appropriately, summons up lunch by the ocean, with its crisp, fresh, dry strawberry and pink grapefruit flavors, just touched by caramel."
France,Loire Valley,Alphonse Mellot 2014 En Grands Champs  (Sancerre),Pinot Noir,94,112.0,"From old vines planted in a single vineyard, this is a spectacular red. It has the crisp acidity of the cool-climate Sancerre, but it also has the weight and ripeness of a fine Burgundy. The wood aging has left a spicy toasty edge to the beautiful cherry fruits and acidity. It could age for another year to be at its best. Drink from 2019."
France,Loire Valley,Domaine Bernard Fleuriet et Fils 2015 Anthocyane  (Sancerre),Pinot Noir,94,60.0,"Old-vine Pinot Noir has produced a rich structured wood-aged wine.

France,Southwest France,Château Coutinel 2015 Red (Fronton),Red Blend,90,28.0,"The estate wine of Coutinel is dominated by the local Négrette grape.

This powerful wine with its blend of Tannat with the two Cabernets (Franc and Sauvignon) is dense and packed with firm tannins.

France,Loire Valley,Domaine de Reuilly 2015 Pinot Noir (Reuilly),Pinot Noir,85,20.0,This is a crisp cherry-flavored wine. Cool-climate Pinot Noir has a light texture that gives the wine a hint of tannins although it is much more about fruit and bright acidity. Drink now.
France,France Other,Les Rocailles 2014 Pinot Noir (Vin de Savoie),Pinot Noir,84,19.0,"This is just recognizably Pinot Noir, full of tannins with a tight edge. Bitter cherry flavors and very fresh acidity give a mineral flavor that is only just showing juiciness. Drink from 2016."
France,Burgundy,Henri de Villamont 2012 Les Champs Claude  (Santenay),Pinot Noir,88,,"With a good structure, this is a solid wine from a small vineyard.

France,Burgundy,Louis Jadot 2009 Petite Chapelle Premier Cru  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,94,85.0,"At this stage, the wine is all dark structure and very firm. It will need time to develop its full potential as an intensely rich wine. Concentrated and firm, it is powered by tannins as well as sweet red fruits. So age for five years at least."
France,Alsace,Domaine Robert Klingenfus 2010 Signature Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,85,17.0,"Light in color, this is a fruity, softly tannic and lightweight wine. It brings out red fruits that are now maturing, giving spice and a touch of pepper with final acidity. Drink now."
France,Burgundy,Domaines Devillard 2011 Château de Chamirey  (Mercurey),Pinot Noir,88,35.0,"A smooth and rounded wine, its ripe plum and blueberry flavors well integrated into the soft tannins and sweet acidity. Drinkable now, but worth waiting for two more years."
France,Burgundy,Domaines Devillard 2011 Domaine de la Ferté Premier Cru Servoisine  (Givry),Pinot Noir,88,40.0,"Very dark, structured wine, with coffee as well as fruit flavors.

It offers pronounced earthy characteristics, as well as a citrusy kick (like tangerine oil) to the blueberry and blackberry fruit core. The mouthfeel is creamy and velvety, with plush tannins and lingering baking-spice flavors."
France,Southwest France,Lionel Osmin & Cie 2011 Donibane Red (Irrouléguy),Red Blend,90,,"Coming from the Basque country, this blend of Cabernet Franc and Tannat is both perfumed and firmly structured.

France,Burgundy,Antonin Rodet 2010  Givry,Pinot Noir,90,35.0,"Givry is one of the unsung values in Burgundy. This ripe and structured wine shows why. It has weight, a firm texture and red plum and strawberry fruit flavors. All these elements are held together by a dark sense of tannin and fine acidity."
France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Le Petit Cochonnet 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Pays d'Oc),Cabernet Sauvignon,86,10.0,"A pleasant mix of dark berries and fruit lead the bouquet of this friendly wine, with solid notes of black cherry, blackberry and boysenberry throughout.

France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Le Petit Cochonnet 2015 Pinot Noir (Pays d'Oc),Pinot Noir,84,11.0,"A light, easy and cheery selection, with direct aromas and flavors of sweet cherry, red raspberry and strawberry.

France,France Other,Barton & Guestier 2011 Bistro Pinot Noir (Ile de Beauté),Pinot Noir,84,8.0,"Soft and fruity with some sweetness, this red-fruit-flavored wine is rounded and warm, crispened by acidity."
France,France Other,L. Tramier & Fils 2010 Bourricot Pinot Noir (Vin de France),Pinot Noir,84,12.0,"This is a soft, gentle Pinot with a plum jelly flavor derived from a touch of sweetness in its fruit. Drink now."
France,Burgundy,Manuel Olivier 2012 Vieilles Vignes  (Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Nuits),Pinot Noir,86,30.0,"In this case, Vieilles Vignes (old vines) only means vines over 20 years. The wine is soft, rounded and full of red cherry fruitiness. Judicious wood aging has rounded the wine out while leaving all its fruit intact. It can be drunk now, but will be better from 2016."
France,Burgundy,Vignerons de Buxy 2012 Buissonnier  (Mercurey),Pinot Noir,86,26.0,"This light-colored wine has a spicy character that points up the tannins as well as the red berry fruits. It has a light feeling, with refreshing acidity that shows strongly at the end. It's ready to drink."
France,Burgundy,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2012 Clos des Rois Premier Cru  (Maranges),Pinot Noir,86,,"From the recent appellation at the southern end of the Côte de Beaune, this is a light and very fruity wine with little discernible tannin or structure. Red cherries and fresh acidity dominate and the wine should be drunk young."
France,Alsace,Domaine François Schmitt NV Blanc de Noirs Brut Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,91,33.0,"Intense notes of ripe red and baked apples make a strong impression. The palate is rich with the same baked apple along with a touch of honey and gingerbread. The yeasty flavors of autolysis provide an ideal backdrop for this structured, grown-up and classy wine. The finish is totally dry and wonderfully long."
France,Burgundy,Joseph Drouhin 2008  Charmes-Chambertin,Pinot Noir,95,164.0,"Structured, concentrated, a wine that shows power from both fruit and tannins. The opulent strawberry flavors are paralleled by firm, dry tannins. As the combination comes together, this will become a glorious wine."
France,Burgundy,Joseph Drouhin 2008 Clos des Mouches Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,94,89.0,"The aromas of smoky new wood follow through to the wood flavors on the palate. However, it's the powerful sweet black cherry and red berry fruit flavors, layered with fruit tannins and acidity, that are driving this impressive wine. For aging at least six years."
France,Burgundy,Bouchard Aîné & Fils 2005 Les Marconnets Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,89,41.0,"Typical Beaune in its round, soft character. If the tannins are not particularly powerful, it still shows a generous nature, with super-ripe fruits supported by some dryness. The finish is jammy, ripe, a salad of red berries."
France,Burgundy,Joseph Drouhin 2011  Chorey-lès-Beaune,Pinot Noir,84,28.0,"The wine is tight, green and herbal. It has some fruitiness, but that is suppressed by general underripeness. The tannins are hard at the end."
France,Burgundy,Pierre André 2011  Ladoix,Pinot Noir,84,29.0,"This tight wine has red fruit acidity without the richness. With its green edge, it's likely to remain full of acidity even as it matures."
France,Burgundy,Demessey 2011 Les Hâtes  (Santenay),Pinot Noir,84,40.0,"A firm wine that is mainly tannin without a great fruit element. It is dry, tight and hard-edged."
France,Burgundy,Albert Morot 2012 Cent-Vignes Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,91,65.0,"This is an austere wine, packed with tannins and tight acidity. The red fruits are right at the back behind the firm structure. A mineral character supports the dusty texture and suggests long-term aging. Drink from 2018."
France,Champagne,Tendil & Lombardi NV Blanc de Noirs Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,91,50.0,"Blanc de Noirs, white Champagne only from red grapes, produces wines with some weight, as here. It makes for a rich, full-blooded Champagne, packed with red fruits while also cut through with intense acidity. The fruitiness gains shape from a zesty texture."
France,Southwest France,Château Laurou 2015 Tradition Red (Fronton),Red Blend,86,12.0,"This entry-level wine from Laurou is spicy and fruity. With a layer of tannins as well as attractive acidity, it is a wine to be drunk young. The aftertaste with its hint of licorice continues the spicy character that comes from the Négrette grape in the blend."
France,Southwest France,Cave du Marmandais 2011 La Vieille Eglise Red (Côtes du Marmandais),Red Blend,88,15.0,"Some firm tannins give solid structure and smoky character to this wine, an exotic blend of Merlot, Abouriou and Malbec. The juicy berry fruits are round and full in the mouth. It's a ripe wine, with a solid structure that gives balance to the fruitiness."
France,Burgundy,Louis Latour 2008 Les Beaumonts Premier Cru  (Vosne-Romanée),Pinot Noir,90,140.0,"A solid, dense wine, packed with tannins and with a dry core. The soft fruit has flavors of strawberry, hinting at richness to come. At this early stage, tannins and acidity are still forming. Hold for five years."
France,Burgundy,Louis Latour 2008 Les Damodes Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,90,95.0,"There is a voluptuous edge to this generous wine. It has rich flavors, some strawberry and plum juice. The final extreme freshness shows through the layer of firm tannins. For aging over 4–5 years."
France,Burgundy,Chanson Père et Fils 2007  Gevrey-Chambertin,Pinot Noir,90,,"Big, structured and solid, with powerful dense fruit, this is packed with plum juice flavors. The wine feels chunky, while the acidity keeps everything in proportion."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Julie Belland 2014 Charmes  (Santenay),Pinot Noir,88,32.0,"The wine is ripe, balanced and likely to be ready to drink soon. With its plump fruitiness and texture, it is a full wine. Rich red-berry fruits are gently balanced by acidity and supported with a light layer of tannins. It will be very drinkable from late 2017."
France,Champagne,Drappier NV Rosé Brut Nature Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,90,60.0,"This bone-dry wine is made using Pinot Noir skins to give its salmon-pink color. It is dry and tightly crisp, compared with the brut nature cuvée also made from Pinot Noir. The ripe red fruits give a fruity character that balances the dryness. Like many really dry Champagnes, it needs to age to soften the intensity of the acidity, so drink this bottling from 2017."
France,Champagne,Boizel NV Blanc de Noirs Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,90,53.0,"This is a rich wine made from a selection of Pinot Noirs, including some from grand cru vineyards. It is textured with hints of tannin as well as yeast and minerality, concentrated while also stylish. Ripe pear and apricot flavors are lively and ripe. A young bottling, it's worth aging until 2017."
France,Burgundy,Louis Max 2013  Côtes de Nuits Villages,Pinot Noir,87,60.0,"From vineyards outside the main village appellations of the Côte de Nuits, this is a firm, almost austere wine. It has a dry extract character that is suppressing the red plum and berry fruit flavors. Give it time, although it is probably always going to be dry."
France,Burgundy,Nuiton-Beaunoy 2015  Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Beaune,Pinot Noir,87,18.0,"Produced by the cooperative of the Hautes Côtes, this wine is bright and fruity.

France,Burgundy,Domaine Jessiaume 2015 Les Gravières Premier Cru  (Santenay),Pinot Noir,88,45.0,The red wine from this vineyard (which also produces a white) is firm with layers of toast from wood aging as well as the potential for ripe red fruits. It is going to need some time to lose that spicy flavor that currently dominates the wine. Give it until 2021.
France,Burgundy,Domaine Michel Goubard 2015 Mont-Avril  (Côte Chalonnaise),Pinot Noir,88,24.0,"This aromatic wine is delicious Pinot Noir. With fine ripe red fruits that are shot through with tannins for aging and crisp acidity for refreshing drinking, this is a rich wine that should be drunk now."
France,Burgundy,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2015 Vieilles Vignes  (Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Nuits),Pinot Noir,88,31.0,"The wine is ripe and warm with generous red-berry fruits and touches of spice. The wine is rounded, full of fruitiness with a layer of tannins that is nicely judged to give support and breadth to the fruit. Drink from 2019."
France,Southwest France,Cave du Marmandais 2009 La Vieille Eglise Réserve Red (Côtes du Marmandais),Red Blend,85,13.0,"With 30% of the local Abouriou grape in the blend, this is herbal and spicy.

France,Burgundy,Bailly-Lapierre NV Brut  (Crémant de Bourgogne),Pinot Noir,91,25.0,"A ripe and soft wine, this is impressively rich for a Pinot Noir grown so far north in Burgundy. It has hints of red fruits along with pear and tight citrus minerality. The wine is ready to drink."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Henri Delagrange 2014 Vieilles Vignes  (Volnay),Pinot Noir,91,64.0,This wine comes from a four-acre parcel of 55-year-old vines. It has the concentration that is so special to old vines. That goes with the ripe red fruits and generous tannins that give the wine great richness. It is a young wine still even though so fruity and will be better to drink from 2019.
France,Burgundy,Maison Stéphane Brocard 2014 Closerie des Alisiers Vieilles Vignes  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,91,48.0,"The mature vines in the name of the wine are 40-years-old. The result is a firm structured wine although one with plenty of soft red fruits in the background. They are developing well, bringing with them acidity and good potential. Drink this wine from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Maillard 2011  Corton Les Renardes,Pinot Noir,91,104.0,"Still young and firm, this wine gives indications of potential fruitiness along with a structure that promises concentration. Layers of black fruits and acidity need time to integrate fully with the dark structure and dense texture. Wait to drink this wine for a few more years, at least until 2018."
France,Burgundy,Au Pied du Mont Chauve 2012 Les Chaumées Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet),Pinot Noir,91,65.0,"This beautifully perfumed wine comes from one of the highest in elevation premier cru vineyards. The tannins have fully integrated with the red berry and cherry fruits to give a soft, jammy character that contrasts with acidity to give a great lift at the end. Drink this sophisticated wine from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Château de Santenay 2012 Les Brunettes et Planchots  (Aloxe-Corton),Pinot Noir,91,55.0,"The two parcels that go into this wine have performed well in 2012. This solid, dense wine is firm with tannins and rich with red plum and berry fruits. It is perfumed, ripe and concentrated. With this structure and with the acidity, it will age, so drink from 2018."
France,Loire Valley,Chavet Fils 2012 Tradition  (Menetou-Salon),Pinot Noir,85,20.0,"This is a style of Pinot Noir that needs to be drunk chilled. It brings out the smoky, stalky character of the wine that dominates the bitter cherry fruits. It's still young and needs another year to come together."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Edmond Cornu 2014  Chorey-lès-Beaune,Pinot Noir,88,,"This wine is fruity and ripe with fresh red-berry fruits and layers of smoky tannins. Those tannins will open up to give a rich, juicy and spicy wine from 2018."
France,Southwest France,Jean-Luc Baldès 2008 Clos Triguedina Red (Cahors),Red Blend,90,,"As pure an expression of a Malbec dominated blend as possible, this is ripe, juicy, packed with fine acidity and underpinned by solid, dry tannins.

France,France Other,Voiturette 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Vin de France),Cabernet Sauvignon,83,10.0,"This wine is a soft, lean selection, with closed aromas and tight flavors of black currant and cherry that struggle to appear fully. The palate is clean but fleeting, with little texture and a short finish."
France,France Other,Maison de la Villette 2015 Pinot Noir (Vin de France),Pinot Noir,83,10.0,"There's a wild character to the nose of this lean, tart Pinot. It offers aromas and flavors of game, sour cherry, tart raspberry and red currant, framed by soft tannins and a fleeting finish."
France,France Other,Belle Made For You NV Cabernet Sauvignon (Vin de France),Cabernet Sauvignon,83,5.0,"This is a jammy and fruit-forward selection, with direct aromas and flavors of red cherry, berry and plum that are lifted by a hint of menthol. The smooth, easygoing palate offers light tannins and fleshy fruit flavors, followed by a clean but fleeting finish."
France,France Other,Belle Made For You NV Red (Vin de France),Red Blend,83,5.0,"This blend of 70% Grenache and 30% Carignan is smooth and easy to drink, with friendly aromas and flavors of red cherry and raspberry that are kissed by a hint of mentholated character. The tannins and low and the finish is short; drink up."
France,France Other,L. Tramier & Fils 2014 Marquis de Brim Grande Réserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Vin de France),Cabernet Sauvignon,83,12.0,"There's an initial astringency to the bouquet of this wine, presented in scents of red-cherry skin, apple and raspberry leaf. The palate offers more of the same, with bitter tannins and fruit-skin flavors that lead into a finish reminiscent of oversteeped black tea."
France,France Other,Patriarche Père et Fils 2014 Pinot Noir (Vin de France),Pinot Noir,83,9.0,"Hints of menthol and cherry cough drop are upfront on the nose. Flavors of red currant, rhubarb and sour raspberry appear on the crisp, tart palate, finishing clean yet short."
France,Burgundy,Nuiton-Beaunoy 2012 Réserve  (Bourgogne),Pinot Noir,84,,"Soft and full of red fruits, this is a simple, forward and immediately drinkable wine, with gentle tannins and light acidity. There are no complications here, just fruitiness."

France,Burgundy,Labouré-Roi 2015  Savigny-lès-Beaune,Pinot Noir,88,40.0,"Ripe with a warm character, this wine has both bright red berry fruit and a rich, generous structure.

France,Southwest France,Domaine de Pellehaut 2008 Harmonie de Gascogne Red (Vin de Pays des Côtes de Gascogne),Red Blend,84,,"Lightweight red from Gascony, with a touch of tannin, red berry fruits and crisp acidity. A red wine with an attractive bite."
France,Alsace,Domaines Schlumberger 2014 Les Princes Abbés Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,87,20.0,A rather dull nose does not want to reveal much. The palate counters this with freshness and a rosehip tartness that has some bitter-edged redcurrant charm. This is fresh and easy and would also work as a chilled red.
France,Burgundy,Faiveley 2014  Bourgogne,Pinot Noir,87,27.0,"Red fruit dominates this attractive, light wine that shows the acidity of the year while also suggesting light tannins. The aftertaste has a touch of smokiness. It will develop quickly."
France,Alsace,Hubert Meyer 2014 Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,87,19.0,"Slightly confected cherry notes open onto a rather soft, somewhat dilute palate with friendly, easy fruit. This might work as a refreshing summer red when chilled."
France,France Other,Château d'Arlay 2007 Pinot Noir (Côtes du Jura),Pinot Noir,84,,"Firmly tannic, this is a structured wine that now lacks fruitiness. It needs to be drunk now."

France,Burgundy,Domaine Heresztyn 2010 Les Millandes Premier Cru  (Morey-Saint-Denis),Pinot Noir,91,94.0,"Deliciously perfumed, this shows some of the structure of the vintage, along with generous raspberry and red cherry flavors.

France,Burgundy,Domaine Faiveley 2007 Les Rugiens Premier Cru  (Pommard),Pinot Noir,90,125.0,"Beautifully perfumed wine, with fresh red fruits and some fine tannins. The wood element is perhaps too dominant for the weight of the wine. Hopefully this will subside. Give it 3–4 years."
France,Burgundy,Maison Jessiaume 2006  Clos de Vougeot,Pinot Noir,90,,"From the new, négociant side of Domaine Jessiaume, now owned by Scottish businessman Sir David Murray.

France,Burgundy,L. Tramier & Fils 2011  Nuits-St.-Georges,Pinot Noir,86,,"The aroma shows old wood flavors that don't work. On the palate, the wood also gives some bitterness that needs to disappear to bring out the best of the red fruits. It's probably always going to be on the hard side."
France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Mont Tauch 1998 Red (Fitou),Red Blend,80,11.0,"Picture grandma standing over a pot of stewed prunes, which fill the dusty old house with their sickly aromas. Cooked, earthy and rustic, this wine has little going for it. Just barely acceptable."
France,France Other,Domaine Maestracci 2015 Clos Reginu Red,Red Blend,87,15.0,"This blend that seems to include every Corsican and Provence red grape works out as a wild and wonderful wine. With acidity, spice, perfume and tannins that bring in a bramble texture, this is a wine for drinking young."

France,Alsace,Domaine Zinck NV Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,87,25.0,"Generous, nearly fleshy notes of strawberry compote give this almost a confected edge. On the palate, this richness is checked by some lemon freshness and some bitter edges while the fizz froths in big, lively bubbles. Drink soon."

France,Burgundy,Domaine Champy 2010 Vieilles Vignes  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,87,,"While this shows the concentration of the vines that were planted in the 1940s, it also has a tight, lean quality and considerable acidity.

France,Southwest France,Château d'Aydie 2013 Domaine Mouréou Red (Madiran),Red Blend,87,16.0,"This wine has firm tannins certainly.

France,Burgundy,Domaine Huguenot 2013 Les Crais  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,92,70.0,"Still firm and tannic, this dense wine will need some time to develop.

France,Loire Valley,Chavet Fils 2014  Menetou-Salon,Pinot Noir,85,20.0,"Still young, this wine has a tight character that needs to open up.

France,Loire Valley,Domaine Gérard Fiou 2014 Terroir Silex  (Sancerre),Pinot Noir,89,30.0,"This wine is produced from old-vine Pinot Noir planted on flint soil.

This will balance out over the next few months to give a wine with concentration. The aftertaste brings out acidity. Drink from 2017."
France,Burgundy,Domaines Devillard 2014 Servoisine Premier Cru  (Givry),Pinot Noir,89,43.0,Vines over 45-years-old in the most northerly vineyard in Givry are the source of this rich smooth wine.

Drink this wine from 2018.
France,Burgundy,Antonin Rodet 2011 Bourgogne A. Rodet  (Bourgogne),Pinot Noir,84,18.0,"A lean, high acid wine that has a dry edge to it. It does have of red fruit flavors but for a basic red Burgundy there is too much structure, not enough ripeness."

An utterly honest and uplifting rendition of Pinot Noir."
France,Alsace,Domaine Pfister 2013 Rahn Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,92,35.0,"Faint hints of aromatic tart cherry try to burst through the closed nose. The fruit is present on the fresh palate with astonishing purity. There is real concentration and a richer, almost plush texture at the core despite the svelte nature of this wine.

France,Burgundy,Simonnet-Febvre NV Brut Rosé  (Crémant de Bourgogne),Pinot Noir,89,19.0,"The cooler northern part of Burgundy is not far from southern Champagne, so it's unsurprising that this is the source of much sparkling Burgundy.

France,Burgundy,Domaine de Suremain 2015 Les Crêts Premier Cru  (Mercurey),Pinot Noir,92,38.0,"The Suremain family winery in the main street of Mercurey has cellars going back to the 17th century.

France,Burgundy,Roche de Bellene 2014 Champeaux Premier Cru  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,93,142.0,"The wine comes from a parcel that is less than an acre.

France,Champagne,Pehu-Simonet 2010 Fins Lieux No 1 Millésimé Grand Cru Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,93,70.0,"This single-parcel, partially barrel-fermented Champagne is in effect a Blanc de Noirs. If all that sounds complicated (and so does the name of the wine), the wine itself is much easier to appreciate. It is certainly rich, with a touch of tannin and mineral texture. Full of ripe white fruits, it offers good acidity at the end. It could age longer; drink from 2017."
France,Burgundy,Roux Père et Fils 2006 Beauregard Premier Cru  (Santenay),Pinot Noir,88,,"There is a firm structure here underpinning the sweet, ripe strawberry flavors. The wine offers freshness from its berry acidity along with a final tight core of tannins. Age for 2–3 years."

There are leathery elements to the nose and wild, grapy fruit that stumbles onto the palate. A wall of tannins hits you on the finish, and throughout it's untamed and overdone. Very fruity and forward, but devoid of tact."
France,Southwest France,Domaine du Moulin 2013 Red (Gaillac),Red Blend,88,12.0,"This 50/50 Duras and Syrah blend from father and son Jean Paul and Nicolas Hirissou is a ripe, fruity wine that is attractively mature.

France,Burgundy,Antonin Rodet 2011 Château de Mercey  (Santenay),Pinot Noir,89,28.0,"While the wine is structured, it does also have plenty of ripe, juicy fruitiness that is already delicious. It's an open wine, rounded and rich in fruit flavor. The tannins are likely to smooth out soon, so drink from 2016."
France,Burgundy,Simonnet-Febvre 2012 Epineuil  (Bourgogne),Pinot Noir,86,20.0,"Earthy aromas and a soft red fruit ripeness are dominated by wood and smoky spice. They give an unbalanced feel to the wine, not allowing much room for the potential of the fruitiness and acidity."
France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Gala Rouge 2006 Pinot Noir (Vin de Pays d'Oc),Pinot Noir,84,10.0,"Simple earthy notes interspersed with faint cherry aromas open this pleasant, good-value Pinot Noir from the south of France. The blueberry-flavored palate shows riper fruit than is typical for Burgundy and may appeal to those who find California Pinots to be a bit overwhelming. Tannins are in abundance here but are fine enough not to interfere with tuna or swordfish in a delicate sauce."
France,Burgundy,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2015 Vieilles Vignes  (Bourgogne),Pinot Noir,85,28.0,"Produced from old vines in the Aegerter Domaine, this wine is dominated by red fruits and spice from wood aging. It is fruity, perfumed and likely to be ready to drink soon. Drink from 2018."
France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Les Jamelles 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Pays d'Oc),Cabernet Sauvignon,85,10.0,"Sweet oak tones frame the black cherry and currant fruit in this wine, with notes of mocha and raspberry sauce atop. The velvety texture offers good tannic grip, while ample acidity helps to keep the palate fresh and the finish lifted. Drink now."
France,Burgundy,L. Tramier & Fils 2015 Collection  (Hautes Côtes de Nuits),Pinot Noir,87,26.0,"Produced from vineyards in the hills above the Côte de Nuits, this wine benefits from the ripe vintage of 2015. It has open red fruit and soft tannins that are both lifted by the acidity. Made to be drunk young, this is ready to enjoy now."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Moillard 2009 Rugiens Premier Cru  (Pommard),Pinot Noir,89,120.0,"While it does have the structure of a Pommard, this is also a ripe, rounded wine. Its sweet red fruits surround the firm tannins offering richness. A wine that will offer sold pleasure in 3–4 years."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Thierry Mortet 2009  Gevrey-Chambertin,Pinot Noir,89,55.0,A beautifully perfumed wine that shows some of the structure of a Gevrey but combines this with dark rich fruits and sweet tannins. There is a smoky flavor that balances the ripe red fruits and final acidity.
France,Burgundy,Domaine Moillard 2009  Côte de Nuits-Villages,Pinot Noir,86,35.0,"A fresh wine with red cherry fruits giving a bright character, the tannins soft and with attractive acidity. It is lightly textured and should be ready to drink in 1–2 years."
France,Southwest France,Producteurs Plaimont 2014 Moonseng Red (Côtes de Gascogne),Red Blend,87,15.0,The producer has the largest nursery of old grape varieties in southwest France and from it has plucked the Manseng Noir to blend with Merlot. The result is a rich wine with ripe Merlot red fruits that are given a more tannic character with the Manseng. There is a fresh juicy aftertaste that allows it to be drunk now.
France,Burgundy,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2016 Belle Canaille  (Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Nuits),Pinot Noir,86,,"Vines in the hills west of Nuits Saint-Georges are the source for this crisp red-currant-flavored wine. It has a juicy character, bright with red fruits. The wine will be ready from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2016 Vieilles Vignes  (Bourgogne),Pinot Noir,86,,"Soft and fruity, this young wine is full of red fruits and attractive acidity. It has a core of tannins that will soften over the next few months. Drink from 2018."
France,Champagne,Duval-Leroy NV Rose de Saignée Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,91,,"The name indicates that this Champagne gets its delicate onion skin pink from the grape skins and not the addition of red wine, as with most rosé Champagnes. Does this make it any better? It's certainly a well integrated wine, the berry fruits very much part of the overall richness and, the acidity in a great supporting role."
France,Burgundy,Vignerons de Buxy 2015 Buissonnier  (Côte Chalonnaise),Pinot Noir,87,20.0,"This is an open delicious wine, full of red-cherry and red-currant fruit with a touch of minerality to add texture. Some wood aging has smoothed out the crisp fruit and added vanilla to the mix. Drink this ripe wine from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Pierre Guillemot 2015 Aux Serpentières Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,87,65.0,The wine is juicy with intense acidity. Its red-currant flavor is consistent with this acidity. Tannins are firm and will soften. The juicy aftertaste gives the wine crispness.
France,Provence,Château la Gordonne 2010 Verité du Terroir Red (Côtes de Provence),Red Blend,91,20.0,"This ripe wine has jammy red fruit flavors. The fruitiness is given structure by the stalky tannins and the dry, wood-aging flavors. Black cherries and juicy black currants show strongly. It needs to age, so drink from 2016."
France,Alsace,Domaine François Schmitt NV Blanc de Noirs Pinot Noir (Crémant d'Alsace),Pinot Noir,90,32.0,"Notions of ripe, yellow apple peel signals that this is a more rounded, slightly more oxidative style, boasting a bready, autolytic backbone. With its rounded yet fresh character, this would make an ideal winter apéritif. Savor the beautiful oatmeal finish."
France,France Other,Les Alliés 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Vin de France),Cabernet Sauvignon,84,12.0,"Dark fruits—plum, cherry and blackberry—are bold and center stage on the nose, with secondary glimmers of licorice stick and black pepper. The palate offers black fruit-skin flavors that are partnered with medium tannins, resulting in a slightly gripping and astringent close."
France,France Other,Tussock Jumper 2014 Pinot Noir (Vin de France),Pinot Noir,84,12.0,"This easy-drinking Pinot leads with bright aromas of red currant, raspberry and strawberry hull, all leaning slightly sour. The palate is light and tangy, with tart red-berry flavors that finish clean."
France,Southwest France,Château Bellevue la Forêt 2004 Red (Côtes du Frontonnais),Red Blend,85,9.0,"With all the freshness given by the Négrette, this is a red fruit dominated wine, its acidity ripe, touched by candy and strawberries. This is a wine to drink now, with all the crispness of 2004 still in place."
France,Loire Valley,Xavier Flouret 2005 Domaine de Châtenoy Rouge Noir  (Menetou-Salon),Pinot Noir,85,25.0,"A lightweight, dusty-smelling Pinot Noir from near Sancerre. The fruit is very soft, with the dryness giving a final firmness to the aftertaste. Flavors of red cherries have a dusty, perfumed character."
France,Southwest France,Château Bouissel 2004 Cuvée Sélection Red (Fronton),Red Blend,84,22.0,"A hard-edged wine, lean and mineral in character. It has a juicy tartness to it, the berry fruits surrounding a curiously hollow center."
France,Alsace,Dopff & Irion NV Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,90,19.0,"Pale pink in the glass, this has a rather fragrant nose that combines strawberry and citrus. The palate is ultralight and very fizzy, exuberant and fresh while remaining dry and full-flavored. Yeasty autolysis provides backbone and structure, while the creamy citrus elements make for complete refreshment."
France,Provence,Ravoire et Fils 2012 Fontanyl Red (Côtes de Provence),Red Blend,87,,"Perfumed and aromatic, this fruity red shows a good sense of structure. Flavors include Mediterranean herbs redolent of lavender as well as red plum, along with a dry core. The wine is ready to drink."
France,Burgundy,Domaine A. Machard de Gramont 2010 Clos Blanc Premier Cru  (Pommard),Pinot Noir,89,61.0,"This is a hard-edged wine, a typical trait of young Pommard. It has a firm, dry and tannic character, and the ripe, generous fruit sits underneath. Wait for at least five years for this wine to be ready."
France,Burgundy,Olivier Leflaive 2010  Santenay,Pinot Noir,89,45.0,"With a proportion of premier cru grapes in the blend, this wine has weight and structure as well as the ripe red-fruit flavors that are typical of Santenay. It's richly textured and full in the mouth. The finish is fruity and soft."
France,Burgundy,Nicolas Potel 2014 Les Petites Lolières Premier Cru  (Aloxe-Corton),Pinot Noir,94,65.0,"Just next door to the Corton Grand Cru vines, this vineyard can produce wines of equal quality. This wine certainly has something of the richness and structure, giving it concentration and longevity. Ripe red fruits are cut by dark tannins and equal acidity, allowing the wine to mature slowly and well. Drink from 2020."
France,Burgundy,Chanson Père et Fils 2013 Clos des Fèves Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,94,118.0,"This wine comes from a vineyard that is wholly owned by Chanson. It is juicy, ripe while having a great, straight line of acidity. The red-berry fruits are still developing and coming through the firm, smoky dark tannins. The wine, with its spicy aftertaste, will be ready to drink from 2020."
France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot 2014 Lavaux Saint-Jacques Premier Cru  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,94,130.0,"This rich wine is dense with dark tannins and concentrated structure. The vineyard, with cool winds from the valley behind, gives wines that demand aging with their tannins and fragrant fruit. The aftertaste is full of promise. Drink after 2022."
France,Burgundy,Domaine des Croix 2014 Les Grèves Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,94,,"This wine is perfumed with cherries and red berries. Its structure, which is certainly there, is almost secondary to this brilliant fruit. Balanced with a mineral dryness, the wine is certainly going to age into a ripe, pure-fruited wine. Drink from 2020."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Jessiaume 2008  Santenay,Pinot Noir,87,28.0,"Jessiaume is based in Santenay and the wine shows the attraction of this village at the southern end of the Côte de Beaune. It reveals soft fruit, warmed by a jammy layer of red berries and ripe acidity."
France,Champagne,Tendil & Lombardi NV Rosé de Saignée Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,87,59.0,"This intensely crisp selection shows its red-currant-driven acidity immediately.

France,Burgundy,Antonin Rodet 2010 Héritage Rodet  (Mercurey),Pinot Noir,88,28.0,"Celebrating the founding in 1875 of Antonin Rodet, this ripe, perfumed wine has red fruits that are opulent, gloriously drinkable already. It's ripe, softly textured, layered with delicate acidity."
France,Burgundy,Vignerons de Buxy 2011 Buissonnier  (Mercurey),Pinot Noir,88,22.0,"The largest appellation in the Côte Chalonnaise produces here a foursquare, solid wine. It has red fruits, although the structure is what is dominant at this stage. There is a dry, smoky, meaty flavor that marches with the final acidity."
France,France Other,Domaine Vico 2015 Red (Corse),Red Blend,89,20.0,"This is a rich, perfumed wine, with spice from new wood, a rich texture and dense red berry fruit. Its structure and concentration suggest it will age further, so wait until late 2018 to drink."
France,Provence,Domaine des Aspras 2013 Les Trois Frères Red (Côtes de Provence),Red Blend,89,20.0,"A blend of Syrah and Grenache from organic vineyards gives a herbal, very southern taste to this ripe wine. It is still young and showing both acidity and a firm structure. As it develops further, it will get a rich, full and plummy character. Drink from 2017."
France,Burgundy,Bouchard Père & Fils 2011 Le Corton  (Corton),Pinot Noir,96,115.0,"This is powerful and rich, allowing just a note of freshness to creep into the firm structure. Dark tannins, black fruits and smoky wood flavors combine harmoniously, lending a sense of great power and long-term aging potential. Drink from 2019."
France,Alsace,René Muré 2015 Signature Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,90,25.0,"The nose is shy and does not give much away. On the palate, beautifully pure red currant and tart red-cherry notes come through. The slender body is pervaded by freshness and has lovely overtones of conifer and oak leaf. It is later on that the fine but firm structure comes to bear. This is light but has depth and the potential to develop."
France,Burgundy,Louis Max 2013 Beaucharme  (Bourgogne),Pinot Noir,85,19.0,"This fresh, fruity wine is full of red cherry and berry flavors. A light touch of tannin holds the fruit and acidity together. It's a fine, simple Burgundy, ready to be drunk now."
France,Burgundy,Domaine de la Vougeraie 2014 Les Grèves Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,91,,"This fresh, fruity wine also has a core of smoky tannins. It is both structured and offers plenty of bright red fruits. The wine is crisp, ripe with a dry core. Drink from 2020."
France,Burgundy,Domaine de la Vougeraie 2014 Les Marconnets Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,91,,"Ripe and juicy, this is a delicious, red-fruit wine. Its tannic structure lies well behind the generous fruitiness. With a dense texture and good acidity, the wine will be full and rich. Drink from 2019."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Arnoux Père et Fils 2014 En Genêt Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,91,55.0,"This two-acre premier cru situated north of Beaune city gives smooth and rich wines. This bottling shows the acidity of the vintage while also having a full, round character, ripe with strawberries and crisp with acidity. The wine needs more time, so drink from 2019."
France,Southwest France,Jean-Luc Baldès 2013 Clos Triguedina Red (Cahors),Red Blend,87,34.0,"This blend of Malbec, Merlot and Tannat is lean and austere—probably the effect of the vintage. That gives powerful tannins and less in the way of fruit. It's firm, hinting at more juicy fruit but likely to remain dry and structured. Drink from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Simonnet-Febvre 2006  Irancy,Pinot Noir,85,20.0,"Irancy produces lightweight Pinot Noir, emphasizing the freshest raspberry flavors, allied to soft, dry tannins. There is a smoky element here that is attractive. The finish, with its acidity, shows the crispness of this northern production area."
France,Provence,Louis Latour 2000 Domaine de Valmoissine Pinot Noir (Vin de Pays Var),Pinot Noir,86,12.0,"Smells like Pinot, with meaty plum and fleshy black cherry aromas. Tastes like Pinot, with a supple texture and cola and black cherry flavors. Why can't more wineries turn out good Pinot at this price?"
France,Southwest France,Domaine D'en Ségur 2010 Le Rouge Red (Côtes du Tarn),Red Blend,85,16.0,"This Gaillac-like blend of Braucol, Duras and Syrah gives rich fruitiness and soft tannins. The wine is juicy, full of red berry and spice and an attractive light touch. It's ready to drink."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Méo-Camuzet 2013 Les Cras Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny),Pinot Noir,93,,"A beautifully perfumed wine, this offers a line of fine tannins and brilliant aromatic fruitiness. Cherries and strawberries show strongly against a backdrop of tannins and structure. The aftertaste, still with a hint of dryness, is round with great fragrant fruit. Drink from 2019."
France,Burgundy,Henri de Villamont 2012 Les Baudes Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny),Pinot Noir,93,,"Smoky aromas hint at a wine with a strong sense of structure and weight. It is concentrated, still full of tannins, dark tension and acidity. Rich strawberry fruits are just a hint at the moment, leaving a wine with power and longevity. Drink from 2019."
France,Burgundy,Château Philippe-le-Hardi 2012 La Brigadière Vieilles Vignes  (Mercurey),Pinot Noir,85,27.0,"This is an earthy wine that shows a rustic character. Still youthful, its fruit is obscured behind a dry, tannic, burnt-toast character. There is a future for this wine, as it should integrate with age, so don't try to drink until 2016."
France,Alsace,Domaine Charles Frey 2015 Quintessence Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,90,,A darker brooding notion of smoke and tar precedes cherry on the nose. The palate remains slender but has backbone and grip. There is depth here and potential. Give this some bottle age: with a little time it will put on flesh. For now it is lithe and refreshing. Drink now through 2022.
France,France Other,Terre de Vignerons 2016 Le Phare Cabernet Sauvignon Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlantique),Cabernet Sauvignon,85,10.0,"Pure Cabernet Sauvignon, this wines comes from the same region as Bordeaux. It has black currant flavors, balanced acidity and a touch of wood aging. Drink from 2018."
France,France Other,Lionel Osmin & Cie 2014 Villa de Cocagne Red (Vin de France),Red Blend,87,11.0,"This blend of Merlot, Tannat and Syrah comes from the southwest near the Atlantic Ocean. That locale gives the tannins and the juicy red fruits a cool, perfumed and lightly stalky character. The acidity is right there along with the soft berry aftertaste that makes the wine drinkable now."
France,France Other,L'original French Kiss NV Pinot Noir (Vin de France),Pinot Noir,87,12.0,"Ripe red berries, cherries and plums lead the bouquet of this friendly and approachable red. Those notes follow through to the creamy palate, while accents of carnation and pressed violet petals add depth and interest. A hint of sweet spice accents the finish."
France,France Other,Le Pépin 2015 Pinot Noir (Vin de France),Pinot Noir,87,7.0,"This is a direct but tasty and well-balanced Pinot, with vibrant aromas and flavors of juicy cherry, blueberry and wild strawberry, all graced by hints of purple flowers and sweet spice. The mouthfeel is soft yet structured, with delicate tannins and a slight lushness that lingers on the finish."
France,Burgundy,Nuiton-Beaunoy 2012  Pommard,Pinot Noir,88,,"Some firm tannins lie at the back of this dry, solid wine. It has dark plum fruits, juicy acidity and a fresher aftertaste. It's balanced and needs a little aging. Drink from 2017."
France,Burgundy,Manuel Olivier 2011  Chambolle-Musigny,Pinot Noir,88,80.0,"Fresh and juicy, this is a soft and rounded wine. It has gentle tannins, along with stylish acidity and red fruit flavors. Already, it is becoming drinkable, so don't expect the wine to age over the long term. Drink from 2016."
France,France Other,Domaine Petroni 2014 Red (Corse),Red Blend,88,20.0,"This is an attractively ripe blend of Niellucciu, Syrah and Grenache. Softly textured with a warm backdrop of blackberry fruit, the wine is spicy and has a distinctly southern-France feel. Its softness means it is ready to drink now."
France,Burgundy,Nuiton-Beaunoy 2012 Les Mouchottes  (Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Nuits),Pinot Noir,87,,"Set at 1,000 feet, the vineyard of Les Mouchottes inevitably produces cool and crisp wines with tangible acidity and strong red currant fruitiness. It's attractive and light, with a bright, fragrant aftertaste. Drink from 2016."
France,Burgundy,Simonnet-Febvre 2012  Irancy,Pinot Noir,87,25.0,"This is a warm and round wine from Irancy, southwest of Chablis. Red fruits are sustained by some wood aging that smoothes out the stalky texture and spice. It's a wine that could age another couple of years to soften it further."
France,Burgundy,Nuiton-Beaunoy 2012  Volnay,Pinot Noir,87,,"While it does have some of the typical Volnay plumpness, this is a light wine that offers sweet strawberry fruits and a strand of acidity. At the end, red currant acidity delivers an attractive fresh aftertaste. Drink from 2016."
France,Southwest France,Domaine d'Escausses 2012 La Vigne Blanche Red (Gaillac),Red Blend,90,17.0,"The “blanc” in the name refers to the white grapes historically planted in this vineyard. Now the vines are a varied red blend of Syrah, Fer Servadou, Merlot and Duras. Seventh-generation winemaker Jean-Marc Balaran creates a fruity, structured wine that is well-balance. Touches of spice from the wood aging complement the smoothness of the wine with its light, fresh aftertaste. Drink now."
France,Southwest France,Château Labastide Orliac 2010 Red (Brulhois),Red Blend,90,30.0,"This small appellation is situated on the south and north banks of the Garonne river near Agen. Using grapes from three-year-old vines, this wine is ripe and juicy in red fruit flavors, with layering acidity that gives a fresh aftertaste. Drink from 2018."

It is full of black fruits and balanced acidity. Its richness reflects the quality of the vintage and its aging potential. Drink from 2022.
France,Burgundy,Château de Santenay 2015  Pommard,Pinot Noir,91,78.0,"This is a ripe wine, soft on the normal tannins of this appellation and big on the black-cherry and berry fruits. It does have a firm core, cushioned by the generous fruitiness. Drink this wine from 2020."
France,Burgundy,Denis Père et Fils 2015  Savigny-lès-Beaune,Pinot Noir,91,31.0,"A ripe and full wine, packed with fruit. It has a toasty character, spice and bright red-berry fruits that give the wine its crisp acidity and balance the riper smooth texture that is developing. Give this wine until 2022."
France,Burgundy,Maurice Ecard 2009 Les Serpentières Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,88,48.0,"Soft and ripe, this is a broad wine. Its tannins are enveloped by the rich plum and damson fruit flavors. It combines the richness of the vintage with the softness of a Savigny in an already delicious whole."
France,Burgundy,Roche de Bellene 2012 Vieilles Vignes  (Bourgogne),Pinot Noir,87,21.0,"This fresh wine is all about fruit. Soft tannins and attractive strawberry flavors are lightly cut with acidity.

France,Burgundy,Louis Jadot 2014 Les Suchots Premier Cru  (Vosne-Romanée),Pinot Noir,93,166.0,"This premier cru, surrounded by grand cru vineyards, has produced a luscious, ripe wine. It's generous in both black fruit flavor and structure, showing great potential for aging. Drink from 2021."
France,Alsace,Hugel 2009 Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,88,,"Hugel has always made a benchmark Pinot Noir. This has weight and richness. It does have a strong wood content that provides some bitterness, though it is rounded out by the note of ripe red plum, lifted by final acidity."
France,Alsace,Domaine Loew 2013 Westhoffen Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,84,,"As often in Alsace Pinot Noir, the wine has too much wood for its fruit. What fruitiness it has—bitter cherries and red berries—is smothered by high toast giving a dry, edgy aftertaste."
France,Alsace,Domaine Ehrhart 2012 Domaine Saint-Rémy Barrique Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,84,33.0,"Definitely wood-aged, this seriously toasty wine seems to have lost its fruit along the way. It gives a hard and tough character that is partly redeemed by juicy acidity at the end."
France,Alsace,Domaine Vincent Stoeffler 2012 Tradition Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,84,27.0,"A red wine that relies on its fruitiness to succeed. Red berries and plums show strongly, aided by acidity. The texture has a stalky character with a bitter green herb aftertaste. Drink now."
France,France Other,Château de Tigné 2014 Gerard Depardieu Pinot Noir (Vin de France),Pinot Noir,87,22.0,"With its attractive red-fruit flavors, this is a light, perfumed wine. It has spice, fine acidity and a smooth texture that is just lifted by tannins. Drink now."

It has spice and wood flavors that are balanced with the red berry and cherry fruits and the crisp acidity of the vintage. With its rich character, it will age gently over the next few years and be ready to drink from 2018."
France,France Other,Clos Venturi 2014 Red (Corse),Red Blend,91,28.0,"This ripe, rich wine is full of fruit. Sweet tannins have merged with the blackberry fruits, making it structured and dense. Spice, balancing acidity and a dark, firm aftertaste all promise further aging. Drink from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Olivier Leflaive 2010  Chassagne-Montrachet,Pinot Noir,87,60.0,"In the past, there was much more red wine than white wine produced in Chassagne-Montrachet. This firm, tannic wine, with its austere fruit, shows a similarity to Pommard. This is a wine that needs to age for over several years in order for it to soften and become round, and for the red berry fruit to surface."
France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot 2010 Les Charmes  (Santenay),Pinot Noir,87,,"A fruity wine, this has exuberant red-berry flavors that suggest this wine can be consumed now. Gentle tannins balance the fine acidity and rich, warm texture."
France,Alsace,Boeckel 2014 Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,89,,Very faint notes of red berry are supported by floral overtones on the nose. The palate has pleasantly bitter elements that enhance the yeasty notes of bread crust. The body remains light while the finish is dry and balanced.
France,Alsace,Bott Frères NV Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,89,19.0,"Creamy notes of Red Delicious apple are tinged with hints of shortbread on the nose. These become more forward on the creamy palate as the frothy mousse amplifies them. This is dry, restrained and elegant with a wonderfully refreshing finish."
France,Burgundy,Roche de Bellene 2010 Vieilles Vignes  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,90,58.0,"Savigny-lès-Beaune often shows the softer side of Pinot Noir. This wine has juicy red-cherry and raspberry flavors that balance the gentle, dry tannins. The low-yielding old vines from which the fruit was sourced give this selection extra concentration. This will benefit from medium-term aging."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Bruno Clair 2010 Vaudenelles  (Marsannay),Pinot Noir,90,,"Located on a high slope in Marsannay, the Vaudenelles Vineyard creates structured wines. This selection has a beautiful perfumed character, and it offers delicious red-berry flavors and lively acids that are striated by minerality."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Jessiaume 2010 Gravières Premier Cru  (Santenay),Pinot Noir,90,47.0,"This is a smooth and polished wine, with herb and new wood aromas. It has juicy red-berry flavors, and the tannins push forward. Structured, with intense acidity, this is ready to age for at least 5–6 years."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Sylvain Pataille 2010 L'Ancestrale  (Marsannay),Pinot Noir,90,73.0,"An old-vine wine, this is powerful, concentrated and impressively dense for a Marsannay. It is full of red plum and berry flavors, plus firm tannins that suggest this could age for several years."
France,Burgundy,Nicolas Potel 2014 Aux Combottes Premier Cru  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,94,115.0,"This wine comes from a vineyard surrounded by Grand Crus. It delivers a huge, smoky palate that is firm with tannins and dense with structure and fruit. The wine is rich, still shot through with the freshness of the vintage. Black fruits are balanced by the dry core of the wine. It will age well, and should not be drunk before 2022."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Faiveley 2014 Les Cazetiers Premier Cru  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,94,145.0,"This wine is already well balanced. Ripe strawberries and red cherries are shot through with the acidity of the vintage. The tannins are present, complementing the already attractive fruits. The aftertaste shows the considerable potential with its tannins. Drink from 2020."
France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot 2014 Domaine du Pavillon Clos des Maréchaudes  (Corton),Pinot Noir,94,150.0,"One-quarter of the Clos des Maréchaudes is classified Grand Cru, as the soil and the slope change. This shows in the power of the wine with its smoky tannins and dark character. Black fruits and a dense texture signify a wine with power and longevity. Drink from 2022."
France,Burgundy,Camille Giroud 2008 Aux Cras  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,89,56.0,"With crushed strawberry and caramel flavors, this is relatively light wine, though elegant and pierced with acidity. Milk chocolate and soft tannins complete an attractive ensemble."
France,Burgundy,Bouchard Père & Fils 2006 Les Pezerolles Premier Cru  (Pommard),Pinot Noir,91,90.0,"The relatively unknown Pezerolles Vineyard is at the far northern end of Pommard, touching Beaune above Les Epenots. It produces wine that seems softer than many Pommards, with rich fruit, the tannins firm but definitely playing second fiddle. It is the smoky plum fruit with just a dash of acidity that makes this immensely pleasing."
France,Burgundy,Chanson Père et Fils 2005 Les Suchots Premier Cru  (Vosne-Romanée),Pinot Noir,91,145.0,"With its sweet wood, dense fruit and jammy character, this is a rich wine. It has some solid tannins, but they are almost lost in the welter of soft strawberry, nutmeg and juicy red berries. Typically with 2005, this is a wine whose opulence appeals now, but those tannins do suggest some good aging."
France,Burgundy,Chanson Père et Fils 2006 Clos des Mouches Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,91,90.0,"Light in color, this rejoices in its perfumed character as much as its fruit. There is a heady smoky aroma, while the palate shows a leaner character. The fruit flavors of red berries are given an extra dimension by the smoky wood and the meaty edge."
France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot 2006 Domaine du Clos Frantin Les Malconsorts Premier Cru  (Vosne-Romanée),Pinot Noir,91,,"The instant appeal of seductive Pinot Noir is here, with its ripe fruits that are poised between sweetness and a pure line of acidity. The fruit is juicy, but always fresh, with wild strawberry flavors and just some spice from wood."
France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot 2006 Domaine du Pavillon Clos des Maréchaudes Premier Cru  (Aloxe-Corton),Pinot Noir,90,,"Exhibiting all the ripeness and richness of an Aloxe-Corton, this wine revels in delicious raspberry fruits, topped with red currant acidity. The wine rolls around the mouth, with a velvet texture on top of some firm tannins. There is a complex sweet and sour aftertaste, as the ripe fruit combines with fresh acidity."
France,Burgundy,Chanson Père et Fils 2006 Bressandes Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,90,80.0,"Soft, sensuous, this is a wine that appeals straight away to the senses. The red fruits float over a soft texture of sweet tannins, leaving a juicy, succulent texture. While it is not a powerful wine, it offers all the delicious characters of Pinot Noir."
France,Burgundy,Capitain-Gagnerot 2013 Les Moutottes Premier Cru  (Aloxe-Corton),Pinot Noir,92,45.0,"This comes from one of the Premier Crus that line the lower slopes of the hill of Corton. It has weight, richness and a densely tannic character that promises aging. Its packed red fruits are cut with juicy acidity as well as a firmer structure and dark-berry flavors. This finely perfumed wine needs to age, so drink from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Coquard Loisson-Fleurot 2014  Chambolle-Musigny,Pinot Noir,90,70.0,"This wine is soft, with attractive, aromatic red fruits. It has the round, ripe feel typical of the village, with just a tannic touch to keep it together. At the moment, the wine is all fruit and acidity, and it needs to develop further to bring out its secondary flavors. Drink from 2017."
France,Burgundy,Michel et Joana Ecard 2014 Aux Serpentières Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,90,75.0,"Rather lean and austere, this is a tight, structured wine. Its future lies in the firm tannins and the juicy red-currant fruit. Wait for this wine and don't drink before 2020."
France,Champagne,De Venoge NV Princes Blanc de Noirs Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,90,72.0,"Bottled in a replica of a 19th-century crystal carafe, this wine is a blend of crus from the Montagne de Reims. On the dry side of brut, it has a lively sliced apple and citrus character as well as refreshing, lively acidity. The wine is ready to drink."
France,Champagne,De Venoge NV Princes Rosé Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,90,90.0,"A crisp, red-currant flavored wine, this offers bright acidity and an attractive tangy texture. In its hallmark De Venoge carafe bottle, it is pure Pinot Noir with the addition of red wine from Pinot Noir to give its pale salmon-pink color. Drink now."
France,Southwest France,Georges Vigouroux 2008 Château Baron Red (Gaillac),Red Blend,87,16.0,"A blend of Syrah and Braucol from the slopes above Gaillac, this fruity, friendly wine has notes of spice and red berry. It's attractively juicy, with soft tannins, and it's ready to drink now."
France,Alsace,Cave de Hunawihr NV Calixte Rosé Brut Pinot Noir (Crémant d'Alsace),Pinot Noir,87,20.0,"This light pink wine is warm, ripe and red-fruit flavored. It is soft and creamy with just the right amount of acidity. There's a refreshing, light aftertaste."
France,Alsace,Willm NV Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Crémant d'Alsace),Pinot Noir,87,14.0,"With just a touch of bitterness and structure, this is a finely textured wine. It has plenty of fresh red and white fruit flavors, a lively, busy mousse and a tight acidity on the finish."
France,Burgundy,Maison Champy 2006 Les Champs Pimont Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,84,,"This wine has distinct acidity, probably too much. Red currant fruits dominate, giving the wine elegance, but also showing some unripe fruit flavors and a texture that is too light and unfocused."
France,Burgundy,Michel Picard 2006  Bourgogne,Pinot Noir,84,,"A light, fresh wine, with flavors of crushed strawberries. There is sweetness, softness, and a rounded aftertaste. Screwcap."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Poulleau Père et Fils 2011 Vieilles Vignes  (Volnay),Pinot Noir,89,,"Old vines always add some concentration to a wine, and this firm and dark wine is no exception. It's also juicy and fruity with a full character that is already attractive but should age well over 4–5 years."
France,Burgundy,Nuiton-Beaunoy 2011  Volnay,Pinot Noir,89,40.0,"The wine has weight, and dense tannins at this stage. What does give it a hint of Volnay's generosity is the warm, full fruit that is behind the structure. It's obviously going to need at least three years to soften out into a more rounded wine."
France,Burgundy,Domaines Devillard 2011 Domaine des Perdrix  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,89,,"Structured wine, with firm tannins as well as a light touch of wood aging. It's a fruity wine, raspberry fruit cut with taut acidity. It can be drunk now for its fruitiness, but would be better allowing the tannins to soften. So drink from 2015."
France,Burgundy,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2012  Bourgogne,Pinot Noir,83,28.0,"This wine is soft, with a light fruitiness and earthy flavors typical of some Pinot Noir. The tannic element gives a dry core to this simple, fruity wine. Drink now."
France,Burgundy,Domaine A. Machard de Gramont 2011 Clos Blanc Premier Cru  (Pommard),Pinot Noir,89,62.0,"A structured wine, it has the weight and the firm tannins to give it aging potential. Black cherries, dark fruits and juicy acidity are paired with the drier tannic structure, amking for a smooth and rich wine. Drink from 2016."
France,Alsace,René Muré 2011 Clos Saint Landelain Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,86,,"Light, fruity, packed with strawberries, this is an attractive Pinot Noir. The only spoiler is the over-excited use of wood which is masking the fruit and will always be an important factor."
France,France Other,Romantic 2014 Authentic & Chic Cabernet Sauvignon (Vin de France),Cabernet Sauvignon,86,10.0,"The medium-intense nose of this solid and easy-to-like Cab offers scents of blackberry, cassis and plum, all laced by hints of cocoa and cigar box. The medium-weight mouth offers a pleasant texture, thanks to moderate tannins and ample acidity, with solid black-fruit flavors at the core."
France,Burgundy,Louis Jadot 2014  Corton-Pougets,Pinot Noir,96,116.0,"This wine produced from vines on the Corton hill is dense and dark, with great power and concentration. Its rich, dark fruit is paired with intense, juicy acidity, ensuring slow development over many years. Drink from 2025."
France,Provence,Le Rouge de Saint-Louis 1998 Red (Côtes de Provence),Red Blend,88,11.0,"Sure it's oaky, but it tastes good, with the subtle menthol and bold vanilla flavors serving to highlight bright cherries. The silky texture is a highlight, then the finish shows off juicy fruit and fine tannins."
France,Burgundy,Pierre André 2007 Clos de Chagnots  (Ladoix),Pinot Noir,87,32.0,"Ladoix is a forgotten Burgundy village that can offer good value. This wine with its strawberry fruits and gentle tannins fits the bill. There is a fine, ripe feel to it, and a dry edge that sets off the fruitiness."
France,Burgundy,Château Philippe-le-Hardi 2009 La Brigardière Vieilles Vignes  (Mercurey),Pinot Noir,87,24.0,There is some weight on this young tasting wine. The tannins are beginning to allow the red berry and damson fruits to open up. Touches of wood round it out for aging.
France,Burgundy,Domaine Poulleau Père et Fils 2011  Bourgogne,Pinot Noir,85,,"There's a kick of dry tannin behind this otherwise ripe wine. Raspberry flavors, red plum skins and a some bitterness add fruit and structure. It needs a year to soften out."
France,Burgundy,Manuel Olivier 2010  Bourgogne,Pinot Noir,85,17.0,"A lightly perfumed wine, this is soft with warm strawberry flavors. The acidity and texture play a supporting role in this ripe, light-bodied wine."
France,Alsace,Frey-Sohler 2009 Fleur de Granit Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,89,,"This tight wine has intense acidity, smoky tannins, a light texture and an attractive strawberry-jelly-flavored finish."
France,Burgundy,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2013 Les Rugiens Premier Cru  (Pommard),Pinot Noir,91,109.0,"Still firm, this wine is dominated by tannin and dark fruit, with a dry core typical of this Pommard vineyard. The red and dark plum-fruit flavors are developing slowly and the wine needs time to balance. Drink from 2019."
France,Southwest France,Domaine d'Arton 2014 La Croix d'Argon Red (Côtes de Gascogne),Red Blend,90,13.0,"This blend of Bordeaux grapes with Syrah is rich and spicy. It is made to be drunk young, with touches of toast and a dense texture that brings out the perfumed character of Syrah balanced with Bordeaux structure. The wine is ready to drink, although it will be better from late 2016."
France,Burgundy,Domaines Devillard 2011 Le Renard  (Givry),Pinot Noir,86,29.0,"Fragrant wine, ripely perfumed, its tannins bringing out red berry fruits and a shapely structure. It also has a fresh feel to it from the intense acidity at the end. Age for a year, but drink now."
France,Burgundy,Domaine de la Pousse d'Or 2009 Clos Tavannes  (Santenay),Pinot Noir,86,88.0,"Dark chocolate notes join acidity and ripe black fruit flavors. The wood is dominant in this relatively soft wine, although the fruit juiciness comes through well to finish."
France,France Other,Bougrier 2015 Alain de la Treille Pinot Noir (Vin de France),Pinot Noir,86,13.0,"This is a juicy, fruit-forward selection, boasting vibrant notes of red cherry, raspberry and strawberry on the nose and mouth. A hint of vanilla adds a sweetness to the finish, which otherwise ends clean and mouthwatering. Drink now."
France,Alsace,Charles Sparr 2013 Tradition Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,84,16.0,"The wine is lean, with more acidity than fruit. It does have a tannin edge that gives it structure but the fact the wine wasn't aged in wood means it lacks any depth. Drink now."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Bart 2014 Grandes Vignes  (Marsannay),Pinot Noir,90,,"This wine is well poised between structure and fresh red fruits. A dark side of firm tannins gives a dry core to the wine, while the bright red-berry fruit is perfumed and fresh. The two elements are integrating well. Drink from 2019."
France,Loire Valley,Domaine des Corbillières 2010 Les Demoiselles Red (Touraine),Red Blend,86,17.0,"This blend of Cabernet France, Malbec and Pinot Noir shows the eclectic range of red grapes at the disposal of a Touraine vigneron. It has also produced a soft, gently tannic wine with perfumed fruits, bitter cherry and a herbal aftertaste."
France,Loire Valley,Domaine Roblin 2010 Grande Côte de la Vallée  (Sancerre),Pinot Noir,86,,"Light Pinot Noir showing an undergrowth aroma, red fruits, soft tannins and a smooth texture. It's not a wine for aging, attractive now with its rounded aftertaste."
France,Burgundy,Chanson Père et Fils 2009 Les Vergelesses Premier Cru  (Pernand-Vergelesses),Pinot Noir,92,50.0,"This has ripe red fruits and soft, integrated tannins, with concentration and a voluptuous exterior. This will be ready to drink soon."
France,Burgundy,Domaines Devillard 2010 Domaine des Perdrix Les 8 Ouvrées Aux Perdrix Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,92,120.0,"While wood aromas are prominent now, this ultimately showcase the ripe red fruits that lie underneath. It has a solid core of tannins, which is balanced by the juicy fruit. Age for 6–7 years."
France,Burgundy,Jean-Claude Boisset 2009 Les Charmes Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny),Pinot Noir,92,110.0,"This is rich, complex and full of ripe fruit. A firm structure underlies the richness, lending concentration and density. The fruit is still reticent and will show more generously in another year. Age for five years."
France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot 2011  Savigny-lès-Beaune,Pinot Noir,85,23.0,"Already dense, this wine seems to lack fruit. The tannins dominate at the moment along with acidity. It's likely to remain quite a tight."
France,Burgundy,Domaine de Bellene 2012 Les Grèves Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,93,100.0,"From a half-acre parcel, this is a delicately structured wine. Delicious, forward red-cherry fruits are juicy and provide lift to the the firm tannins. The combination and balance of the fruit and the texture result in a wine that will age well. Drink from 2018."
France,Alsace,Pierre Sparr NV Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,88,23.0,"Bright pink in the glass, the nose is full of bruised apple-peel hints. The frothy palate then majors on ripe juicy red-apple flavors and boosts them with bubbly foam. The finish is dry and very refreshing."
France,Burgundy,Pierre Gruber 2014  Bourgogne,Pinot Noir,84,19.0,"This light-colored wine is attractively perfumed but with a grassy edge that suggests the fruit was underripe. Built for the short term, it will be ready from late 2017."
France,Burgundy,Manuel Olivier 2009  Bourgogne,Pinot Noir,84,12.0,"An attractively simple, fruity Pinot Noir. It has ripe wild strawberry and red plum flavors, spiced with a gamy edge. The wine has a light structure, and is not for aging."
France,Burgundy,Manuel Olivier 2008  Hautes Côtes de Nuits,Pinot Noir,84,14.0,"Light Pinot Noir, with crisp raspberry flavors. The very fruity wine has an edge of bitterness to go with the acidity."
France,France Other,Lionel Osmin & Cie 2010 Estela Vintage Red (Vin de Liqueur),Red Blend,88,24.0,"A fortified blend of Tannat and Malbec, this is a ripe and sweet, styled like a vintage Port. It has a powerful structure from the two tannic grapes in the blend, along with ripe damson fruit and spice, with acidity on the finish."
France,Burgundy,Henri de Villamont 2010  Clos de Vougeot,Pinot Noir,93,169.0,"This is a seriously structured, impressive wine that comes from a parcel in the center of the Clos de Vougeot. It is firm and solid—a powerhouse of richness and density—with dark tannins, ripe black fruits and tight acidity. With this kind of structure, the wine certainly needs to age, so don't drink before 2017."
France,Burgundy,Henri de Villamont 2010  Corton Les Renardes,Pinot Noir,93,76.0,"Firmly tannic still, this wine is fully ripe, rich and structured. Considerably powerful, it's full of red fruits and dark plums cut with a fine line of acidity. Finishes fresh, with sweet tannins that linger. Drink this fine wine from 2017."
France,Burgundy,Jean-Claude Boisset 2011 Les Charmes Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny),Pinot Noir,93,140.0,"While soft and opulent initially, this wine reveals a structured, mineral character on the palate. Ripe red cherry and black plum flavors pair well with firm, dry tannins and hints of wood aging. This is an elegant wine that needs aging. Don't drink before 2017."
France,Burgundy,Seguin-Manuel 2015 Vieilles Vignes  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,88,30.0,"Dominated by red-currant fruits, this is a soft wine with tannins in the background. It has a toasty edge from the wood aging while leaving most of the singing to the fruit. Drink from 2021."
France,Burgundy,Roche de Bellene 2014  Corton,Pinot Noir,95,142.0,"While the color of this wine is light, the intensity and the structure are not. It comes from 30-year-old vines, planted densely that gives the wine huge concentration. It is firm full of tannins that lie over the ripe fruit. As it develops, this wine will be sumptuous, ripe and impressive. Wait until 2023."
France,Burgundy,Derey Frères 2008 Vieilles Vignes  (Fixin),Pinot Noir,86,36.0,"Fixin, the northernmost red wines on the Côte de Nuits, generally produces light wines. This is no exception; the wine is bright, very fresh, with hints of berry fruits."
France,Champagne,Jean Josselin NV Audace Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,85,40.0,"Bright pink in color, this rosé is full in the mouth with red berry flavors and intense acidity. A touch of bitterness gives a sharp aftertaste."
France,Burgundy,Camille Giroud 2008 Les Crais  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,91,56.0,"For a Gevrey, this wine emphasizes softness rather than structure. It does have good depth of flavor and is full of acidity and red berry fruits. The wine offers pleasure now, while having medium-term aging potential."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Bertagna 2008 Les Beaux-Monts  (Vosne-Romanée),Pinot Noir,91,100.0,"Pure, generous, red cherry fruit scintillates over a structured wine that has dense tannins and texture. The whole is pierced with the dominant acidity of 2008."
France,Burgundy,Alex Gambal 2009 Vieilles Vignes  (Vosne-Romanée),Pinot Noir,91,72.0,"Smoky aromas introduce a wine that is structured and concentrated, with intense fruit and acidity. Firm tannins, a subtle touch of wood and fine richness all combine mellifluously."
France,France Other,Les Vins Skalli 2006 Robert Skalli South of France Pinot Noir (Vin de Pays de l'Ile de Beauté),Pinot Noir,83,15.0,"Produced from grapes from the island of Corsica, this soft, open Pinot Noir has some pleasing fresh berry fruits, hints of strawberries and soft tannins. Ready to drink now."
France,Alsace,Kuentz-Bas 2011 Trois Châteaux Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,88,42.0,"This soft, ripe Pinot Noir manages to balance the fragrant red fruits with a gentle massage of wood aging. A firm layer of tannins gives structure and it is ready to drink."

France,Burgundy,Manuel Olivier 2011  Gevrey-Chambertin,Pinot Noir,88,70.0,"Retaining a good sense of structure, this is also a relatively light and fresh Gevrey-Chambertin. It has plenty of raspberry and red plum flavors and lively acidity at the end. Drink from 2015."
France,Burgundy,Domaines Devillard 2010 Le Renard  (Givry),Pinot Noir,85,22.0,"Light, bright and fruity, this has soft tannins, plenty of red fruits and balancing acidity. Just dry to finish, it is ready to drink now."
France,Burgundy,Joseph Drouhin 2012 Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny),Pinot Noir,92,82.0,Drouhin has significant holdings in a number of top Chambolle vineyards. This wine is a blend from other Premier Crus in the same village. It has the typical generous character along with a more serious structured backbone that gives a dry and solid density that's worth aging. Drink from 2017.
France,Provence,Les Vignobles Gueissard 2012 Cuvée G Red (Bandol),Red Blend,92,22.0,"This is a rich, aromatic and deliciously herbal wine full of structured black fruits and dense tannins that promise aging.

France,Loire Valley,Fournier Père et Fils 2014 Les Belles Vignes  (Sancerre),Pinot Noir,87,27.0,"The wine is stalky with tight tannins and just a touch of spicy wood. It has acidity, bitter cherry fruits and structure. Drink now."
France,Loire Valley,Château la Varière 2011 La Chevalerie Cabernet Sauvignon (Anjou Villages Brissac),Cabernet Sauvignon,91,50.0,"Dark in color, this powerful and concentrated wine is still very young. There is possibly too much extraction here that shows in bitterness, but the wine also has the potential for aging with its rich underlying fruitiness. Don't drink before 2015."
France,Burgundy,Louis Bouillot NV Perle de Nuit Blanc de Noirs Brut  (Crémant de Bourgogne),Pinot Noir,87,22.0,"Warm and rounded wine, with almond flavor and the ripe red fruits to go with the intense and balancing acidity. The wine is rich, while also well textured, giving fine final acidity."
France,Burgundy,Pierre André 2009 Les Forges  (Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Beaune),Pinot Noir,87,,"Benefiting from the ripe 2009 vintage, the wine shows more ripe fruit than is usual from the Hautes-Côtes. It has rich strawberry flavor along with acidity. The soft tannins add a light sense of structure."
France,Loire Valley,Domaine Delaporte 2014  Sancerre,Pinot Noir,91,,"The wine is young and still firm with dry tannins. It has really fresh red-berry fruits that are going to need time to broaden out. For now, the wine shows the fruitiness of the vintage and with a solid texture for aging. Drink from 2017."
France,Alsace,Robert Karcher et Fils 2014 Cuvée du Commandeur Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,86,24.0,A strangely bitter note mingles with unusually high-toned leafy red-fruit notes. The palate is slightly bitter but dry and fresh. The body is very light. Drink soon.
France,Burgundy,Manuel Olivier 2008 Les Damaudes  (Vosne-Romanée),Pinot Noir,92,39.0,"Dark colored wine, which translates into richness and flavors of full-bodied damsons and plum fruits, with finely judged tannins and wood. Natural power, with concentration and final acidity to give just the right lift."
France,Loire Valley,Domaine Vacheron 2015  Sancerre,Pinot Noir,92,40.0,"Expanding on their fathers' legacies, the cousins Jean-Laurent and Jean-Dominique Vacheron have a deserving reputation for their almost-Burgundian Sancerre. This latest vintage, packed with both fruit and structure, shows why. It is ripe with red cherries and dark plums laced with acidity. The wine is full of great ripe fruit and generous tannins. Drink from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Jessiaume 2015 La Comme Premier Cru  (Santenay),Pinot Noir,90,45.0,"The Domaine, which is based in Santenay, has produced a wine that has structure as well as ripe fruits. The combination promises good aging with the red-plum fruits likely to mellow into a rich concentrated wine. It is a wine to keep and age, and not drink before 2021."
France,Burgundy,Louis Latour 2015  Savigny-lès-Beaune,Pinot Noir,90,45.0,"The wine is ripe with red-cherry and plum flavors and plenty of acidity to balance.

France,Provence,Château Deffends 2012 Red (Côtes de Provence),Red Blend,85,15.0,Black plum fruits start this wine on a good basis. But the hard tannins and medicinal character are not pleasant. It might improve by 2015.
France,Provence,Château Paradis 2010 Red (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence),Red Blend,91,,"This is a wine with good wood aging, a delicious perfumed character and firm tannins. It has weight and richness, with spicy Syrah lending an exotic feel to the wine. Drink from 2016."
France,Loire Valley,Domaine Sautereau 2014 Côte de Reigny  (Sancerre),Pinot Noir,89,23.0,"Some barrel aging has given this wine, with its already ripe fruits, extra richness. It is spicy, lifted by juicy acidity from the black cherries and plums. This is a full, warm and ripe wine that is just now ready to drink."
France,France Other,Domaine Torraccia 2013 Oriu Réserve de Torraccia Red (Corse Porto Vecchio),Red Blend,90,45.0,"Despite its light color, this is a wine for aging. Even now, the tannins are firm and give a dry texture to its red berry fruit. With acidity as well as structure, it's built for powerful meat dishes. Drink from 2018, when the tannins will have softened further."
France,Alsace,Zusslin 2010 Bollenberg Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,86,35.0,"Very textured wine, hinting at fruit that is only just ripe. This light and fragrant wine has red currant fruits and a smoky character. Probably not for aging."
France,Southwest France,Domaine Roumagnac 2012 O Grand R Red (Fronton),Red Blend,89,13.0,"Made from the oldest vines on the estate, this ripe and fruity wine is ready to drink. Its tannins are already integrated, leaving a smooth-textured wine that is accompanied by spice and red plum fruit flavors."
France,Burgundy,Louis Jadot 2011 Clos des Gatsulards  (Santenay),Pinot Noir,85,37.0,"Very jammy in character, this is a soft, ripe wine. It seems almost too ripe, a wine that is rounded without great texture. It will be ready to drink by the end of the year."
France,Burgundy,Henri de Villamont 2011  Chorey-lès-Beaune,Pinot Noir,85,32.0,"Still very young, it's full of acidity as well as bright raspberry fruits that give freshness. This light wine will soon be ready to drink."
France,Burgundy,Maison Champy 2008 Les Fichots Premier Cru  (Pernand-Vergelesses),Pinot Noir,91,,"A cool, elegant wine, the wood in harmony with the black cherry and mulberry fruits. The wine is properly structured and dense, the dry tannins lending great support to this fine, mineral-inspired wine."
France,Burgundy,Domaine de Courcel 2007 Fremiers Premier Cru  (Pommard),Pinot Noir,91,,"Sweet, jammy fruit with spice from wood aging give a rich and soft wine, packed with ripeness, red cherries and blackberry. At this stage, the wood is major, and needs time to integrate."
France,Burgundy,Henri de Villamont 2007 Les Evocelles  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,91,,"A fine combination of tannins and ripe fruit, rich and at the same time solidly structured. The year brings out soft acidity and blackberry juice, and the wine finishes big and bold."
France,Burgundy,Henri de Villamont 2007 Les Groseilles Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny),Pinot Noir,91,,"Groseilles is French for red currant, and there is a definite red-fruit character here, with a hint of smokiness and sweet tannins over layers of wood. The wine is still young and relatively soft, but offers aging over the next three to four years."
France,Burgundy,Chanson Père et Fils 2007 Les Grèves Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,91,,"From Chanson's five-acre parcel of the Beaune Grèves vineyard, this is a ripe, softly tannic wine, more dominated by strawberry flavors, rich and deliciously sweet. Not for long-term aging, but worth 2–3 years' waiting."
France,Burgundy,Joseph Drouhin 2007 Beaune Grèves Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,91,51.0,"A deliciously soft, smoky wine, the tannins a hint behind the rounded fresh berry and red-plum fruits. There is a great juicy character to go with the fresh acidity and the final, drier structure."
France,Alsace,Domaine Charles Frey 2014 Extra Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,87,28.0,"Plum and berry, cherry and red apple all appear readily on nose and palate of this fruit-driven rosé. The palate tones this down with some bitter edges but they still remain lithe and refreshing. The finish is reminiscent of bruised apple. This will work better with food than as a mere apéritif."
France,Burgundy,Henri de Villamont 2008 Les Champs-Claude  (Santenay),Pinot Noir,87,,"Fresh, simple fruits, with plum skin texture and acidity. There is a fine layer of soft tannins. A wine to drink over the next two years."
France,Southwest France,Château Bouissel 2011 Le Bouissel Red (Fronton),Red Blend,90,,"The local grape Négette is a major party in this blend alongside Syrah and Malbec. This is a perfumed, ripe wine that has more generous fruit than tannin. Red berries dominate alongside acidity and a mineral-textured character. It's still fresh, fruity and needs time. Drink from 2017."
France,Loire Valley,Pascal & Nicolas Reverdy 2014 Terre de Maimbray  (Sancerre),Pinot Noir,90,,"This is a finely perfumed wine, rich in both structure and ripe fruits. It is smoothly textured, a full-bodied wine that has dark cherry flavors as well as a balanced layer of acidity. The wine is still young, juicy and will develop further, so drink from 2017."
France,Champagne,Vollereaux NV Brut Rosé de Saignée Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,87,40.0,This is an unusual rosé for Champagne. It is made 100% from Pinot Noir rather than a blend. And it is made by getting color directly from the fermenting grapes rather than the normal Champagne process of adding red wine. The result is a dark-colored rosé that has a tannic structure as well as red fruits. It is rich and concentrated with ripeness rather than great freshness. It is definitely a food wine.
France,Burgundy,Henri de Villamont 2005 Clos des Guettes Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,89,35.0,"Firmly structured, with bitter black cherries, red berry fruits and concentrated but vibrant fruit.

France,Burgundy,Louis Latour 2005 Domaine Latour  (Aloxe-Corton),Pinot Noir,89,50.0,"From its own estate, this Louis Latour wine is a ripe, strawberry- and juicy plum-flavored wine, sustained by a well- judged dry layer of tannins. It is sweet, the acidity showing through in the red fruits."

France,Burgundy,Louis Jadot 2005 Les Chouacheux Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,89,40.0,"Very fresh, very raspberry, this wine opens gently with sweetness and roundness. The tannins do come into play, but ever so gently, a counterpoint to the sweet, fine fruits that dominate this attractive, relatively early drinking wine."
France,Alsace,Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2013 Vieilles Vignes Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,90,55.0,The closed nose leads onto a compact palate that mixed red cherry notes with sandalwood oak spice. This is elegant and evolves beautifully in the glass. It will sing with earthy mushroom dishes.

France,Southwest France,Domaine Damiens 2014 Tradition Red (Madiran),Red Blend,85,18.0,"This is a stalky wine. Even though it is full in the mouth, it still has a tight, green character typical of unripe Tannat. The blend is 80% Tannat, 10% Cabernet Franc and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon. Tannins and bell pepper flavors go with the firm structure and the acidity at the end. Drink from 2017."
France,Burgundy,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2011 Les Damodes Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,92,,"This ripe, full and structured wine is developing well.

France,Southwest France,Château Flotis 2012 Red (Fronton),Red Blend,87,18.0,"The wild perfumes of the Négrette dominate this wine. Giving aromas of roses and beetroot and black fruit flavors, it is firm with young tannins. The wine is still developing and should age at least until 2018."
France,Southwest France,Domaine d'Escausses 2014 Cuvée des Drilles Red (Gaillac),Red Blend,87,15.0,"This predominately Duras wine is fresh and fruity with an attractive depth of smoky tannins and structure.

France,Southwest France,Château Flotis 2010 L de Flotis Red (Fronton),Red Blend,86,14.0,"A Négrette-based wine, this is full of red berry flavors and that leathery, polished character that is typical of the grape.

France,Champagne,Piollot Père et Fils 2014 Come des Tallants Zéro Dosage Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,88,45.0,"This still-young crisp wine is full of apple and citrus acidity. The mousse is lively, giving a bright character to this fruity wine. Because it is so dry, it needs another few months before drinking, so wait until 2018."
France,Alsace,Domaine Charles Frey 2014 Quintessence Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,90,38.0,"A closed nose leads to a gently concentrated palate of tart aromatic red-cherry fruit pervaded by conifer notes. Very finely structured tannins create a texture of starched crackling silk while darker cherry notes lurk in the background and are met with juicy freshness. This is aromatic, elegant and long."
France,Alsace,Domaine Rieflé-Landmann 2015 Bonheur Convivial Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,90,20.0,"Fresh notes of crunchy red cherry have a spicy edge of pepper. The body of this slender Pinot Noir is very light, totally peppery and very appetizing. The structure is soft and very refreshing. This could also be chilled and is a fabulously light-bodied but sprightly lunch red. The finish is perfectly dry and very enlivening."
France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot 2005 Domaine du Clos Frantin Aux Malconsorts Premier Cru  (Vosne-Romanée),Pinot Noir,95,115.0,"A superb wine, the tannins carrying along the dense structure with ease and grace.

France,Burgundy,Louis Jadot 2005 Les Baudes Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny),Pinot Noir,95,95.0,"This is a wonderful wine, very ripe, the blackberry and sweet fruits all here, While the tannins are solid and concentrated, they are in the center of a lush, beautifully rich series of flavors that range from fruit to licorice to spice. The wine shows great aging potential."

France,Burgundy,Chanson Père et Fils 2007 Domaine Héritiers Paul Chanson  (Corton Vergennes),Pinot Noir,95,,"Rounded and fat, with the weight and power of white wines from Corton. The texture is taut, still very young, waiting to allow the full richness of the fruit to come through. Impressive, it needs a minimum of four years aging."
France,Burgundy,Chanson Père et Fils 2007  Chambertin Clos de Bèze,Pinot Noir,95,,"With its solidly dry tannins, this is a powerhouse, very dark in texture, very structured.

France,Burgundy,Chanson Père et Fils 2009  Nuits-St.-Georges,Pinot Noir,88,68.0,"A foursquare, solid wine that shows its structure right up front. It is backed by red fruits and acids that lend a warm feeling. Full and dense, this needs to age."
France,Burgundy,Calvet 1998 Calvet Premiere  (Bourgogne),Pinot Noir,85,17.0,"Light and taut, this blend from Nuits-St.-Georges, Volnay and Pernand-Vergelesses offers an odd combination of elements. There are bright cherry-kirsch aromas, cherry and earth flavors and a nice mouthfeel sporting a chalky note. But there’s also an odd, candied edge to the fruit and a touch of greenness. Finishes tart, dry and fairly full, but with somewhat tough tannins."
France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Calvet 1998 Cabernet Sauvignon (Vin de Pays d'Oc),Cabernet Sauvignon,85,7.0,"Accurate varietal character abounds in this value red. There’s dark berry and a slight herbaceousness, but not in an off-putting way. Light in style but it possesses nice mouthfeel with smooth cassis fruit and a decent finish."
France,Alsace,Clément Klur 2011 Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,85,30.0,"Bright, ripe strawberry and cherry flavors are contrasted with the firm tannins of wood aging. This is a very young wine, with layers of acidity, spice and toast. Drink from 2016."

France,Burgundy,Louis Max 2009 Domaine de la Créa Les Beaumonts  (Chorey-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,86,,"A firmly tannic wine, with flavors of smoky wood and plum skin. Equally relying on its lean structure, acidity and fruit, this needs to age for 2–3 years."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Jessiaume 2008 Brouillards Premier Cru  (Volnay),Pinot Noir,92,50.0,"Here is all the right Volnay richness. The tannins give the wine a firm edge, a support for the soft, opulent center. Black berry and damson flavors are dominant, offering acidity to go with the ripe texture. Age for 5–6 years."
France,Champagne,Jean Laurent 2005 Blanc de Noirs Millésimé Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,92,93.0,"A pale gold color leads into a wine that is mature and rich. The fruits have mellowed into almond and spice, with attractive acidity, while the ripe texture remains. The balance is just right in a wine that is generous and full in the mouth. Drink now."
France,Burgundy,Domaine A. Machard de Gramont 2010 Les Morais  (Aloxe-Corton),Pinot Noir,88,43.0,"Wood aging has imparted a slight bitterness to the ripe fruit. The juicy red-cherry flavor is melded into the firm tannins, and the finish is bright and round."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Champy 2010  Pommard,Pinot Noir,88,,"Made from grapes that were sourced from two parcels, this Pommard is firmly structured, and it shows fine red-fruit flavers that sit under the dark, dense tannins. It has a ripe yet minerally texture."
France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot 2010 Clos de l'Ermitage  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,88,,There is a touch of minerality in this wine as well as a dry edge and ripe red-fruit flavors that are already attractive. It should be aged at least three years.

France,Burgundy,Henri de Villamont 2005 Les Châtelots Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny),Pinot Noir,91,62.0,"Soft and opulent, relishing its rich fruits and round, velvet structure, this wine hits all the right notes.

France,Burgundy,Domaine de l'Arlot 2005 Clos des Forêts St Georges Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,91,,"A bruiser of a wine: dark tannins, brawny structure, tough and hard around the edges.

France,Burgundy,Domaine Guillot-Broux 2003 Beaumont  (Mâcon-Cruzille),Pinot Noir,86,,"There aren't many 2003 wines available today, and this raisin and red fruit flavored wine shows plenty of attractive ripe flavors.

France,Burgundy,Roche de Bellene 2012 Vieilles Vignes  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,92,75.0,"This powerful, dense wine has a good, long journey to travel. The 20% wood aging has given a surprising amount of toastiness to the black plum fruit and intense acidity. It needs to age, so drink from 2020."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Alain Jeanniard 2011 En Combe Roy  (Fixin),Pinot Noir,88,,"Solid and tannic, this is a full-bodied wine with potential. Ripe fruits are dense and juicy.  With both structure and fruit, this wine will develop well. Drink from 2017."

France,Burgundy,Roux Père et Fils 2006 Les Grands Epenots Premier Cru  (Pommard),Pinot Noir,90,,"Firm and tannic, a wine that, at this stage, is putting structure before fruit.

France,Alsace,Domaine Marcel Deiss 2014 Burlenberg Red (Alsace),Red Blend,93,36.0,"A slightly brooding nose suggests brambly fruit as well as freshness. The palate crunches with red and black cherry, imbued with a kind of boyish impish joy. This is disarmingly rustic, but also very, very unusual and utterly moreish in its singular and honest simplicity. Drying tannins coat the mouth while juicy tart freshness makes you want to take another sip. This is all about stormy, romantic wilderness. Beware, this might just steal your heart."

France,Champagne,Montaudon NV Blanc de Noirs Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,89,40.0,"Typically rich, this Pinot Noir-based Champagne is ripe with red apple, quince and plum flavors. The fruit is balanced by the steel and mineral edge that gives the wine a tight texture."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Champy 2010 Aux Forches  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,87,,"This is firmly structured, and it shows the earthy fruit character of Savigny. The red plum flavor is cut with acidity. It's worth aging for 2–3 years."

France,Burgundy,Domaine de la Vougeraie 2005  Pommard,Pinot Noir,91,50.0,"This is a rich, rounded wine with pure red berry aromas. The initially soft tannins has a dryness that creeps up as the fruit increases in its richness. Layers of wood spice support the fruit rather than dominating."

France,Loire Valley,Henri Bourgeois 2013 Les Baronnes  (Sancerre),Pinot Noir,87,27.0,"This is a lighter style of Pinot Noir than some produced in Sancerre today.

France,Alsace,Lucien Albrecht NV Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Crémant d'Alsace),Pinot Noir,87,23.0,"From 100% Pinot Noir, here is a delicious, crisp, wild raspberry- and mulberry-flavored wine. The acidity shines through the fruit skin texture, giving a mouthtingling feel."

France,Burgundy,Pierre Olivier 2005  Côtes de Nuits Villages,Pinot Noir,85,,"A strangely spicy aroma is followed on the palate by very dry tannins, which dominate the red fruits. The wine has some potential, but has obviously come from grapes that are on the tart side. The finish has high acidity."
France,Burgundy,Maison Champy 2006 Les Bussières  (Chambolle-Musigny),Pinot Noir,85,75.0,"A wine that seems to take the softness of Chambolle-Musigny too far.

France,Burgundy,Domaine Bruno Clair 2010 Les Véroilles  (Chambolle-Musigny),Pinot Noir,92,,"The grapes to make this rich, ripe wine were sourced from vines that were planted in the 1980s. The vineyard, which is located next to Bonnes Mares, yields wines that have an open, generous style, plus elements of structure that lend aging potential. Ready to drink in two years, but it should age well for many more."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Faiveley 2010 Les Damodes Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,92,100.0,"With its firm tannins and structure, this is a wine that's made in the traditional Nuits-St.-Georges style.

France,Burgundy,Henri de Villamont 2011 Le Village  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,90,,"Ripe and fruity, it shows both good acidity and attractive tannins. It has weight, red cherry flavors and a structure that supports the fruitiness. It's delicious but needs more time. Drink from  2017."
France,Burgundy,Pierre André 2011  Savigny-lès-Beaune,Pinot Noir,90,30.0,"Rich as well as structured, it's ripe and already delicious. Berry and cherry fruits are nicely surrounded by both acidity and tannins. Full in the mouth, it's going to be an estimable wine. Drink from 2017."

France,Burgundy,Domaine de Bellene 2014 Vieilles Vignes  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,91,78.0,"Produced from 65-year-old vines, this is a rich and perfumed wine from the estate of Nicolas Potel. It is structured, balancing the red fruits and acidity with a solid framework of tannins. Spice from the wood aging shows lightly, while the wine finishes with crisp red-currant acidity."
France,Burgundy,L. Tramier & Fils 2013 Collection  (Vosne-Romanée),Pinot Noir,91,150.0,"In the prestigious village of Vosne-Romanée, there is little room for anything but Grand and Premier Cru vineyards. This wine, from the flatter ground at the bottom of the slope, shows something of the structure that makes the great wines. To balance that it also has bright fruit and plenty of acidity. It will be ready to drink from early 2018."
France,Burgundy,Maison Stéphane Brocard 2014 Château d'Antigny La Rue du Port  (Pommard),Pinot Noir,91,50.0,"This village wine comes from a parcel of low-yielding 70-year-old vines. It is firm and concentrated with a strong layer of tannins over black fruits. Blackberry and black plum are balanced by the acidity. Together with the tannins, they promise aging. Drink from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Manuel Olivier 2011 Premier Cru  (Pommard),Pinot Noir,88,80.0,"While this wine certainly has a tannic background, it is already showing fruitiness and ripe berry and red plum flavors. That makes for a warm, rounded wine that will age relatively quickly. Drink from 2016."
France,Burgundy,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2011  Vosne-Romanée,Pinot Noir,88,,"This structured wine also has bright red fruits and juicy acidity. It's an attractive bottle now, the tannins showing through while leaving room for an elegant, leisurely aftertaste. Drink from 2015."
France,Burgundy,Château de Santenay 2015 Les Pruliers Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,93,105.0,"There is a fine perfumed character with this wine. It floats above the ripe cherry and berry fruits and the firm structure of rich tannins. The vineyard, centrally located in Nuits-Saint-Georges, has given a firm wine with the great potential to be generous. Drink from 2021."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Arnoux Père et Fils 2015 Les Peuillets Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,93,,"Bold and ripe, this is a rich wine. It has great red-cherry and berry fruits that are filled out by the dry core of tannins. It comes from a vineyard that is close to the premier crus of Beaune and it has something of the extra structure and texture of that appellation. That means it will need to age. Drink from 2022."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Jessiaume 2015 Les Brouillards Premier Cru  (Volnay),Pinot Noir,93,50.0,"Translated, the name of this vineyard means fogs, maybe a reference to a predisposition to get misty in the morning. Adjacent to Pommard, the wine has some of the structure of that village allied to the rounder character of Volnay. Together, these elements make for a wine that is likely to age well. Drink this ripe and smoky wine from 2023."
France,Burgundy,Henri de Villamont 2015 Châtelots Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny),Pinot Noir,93,,"Packed with tannins, this dark-hued wine is concentrated, demanding aging.

It's fresh, ripe, just lightly touched by tannins, and with a juicy, friendly aftertaste."
France,Burgundy,Bouchard Aîné & Fils 2005 Clos du Roi Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,88,41.0,"There is some good depth of flavor to this wine, the strawberry flavors going right through until they meet the tannic core. The acidity balances well, pushing the fruit through the dryness, leaving freshness and juicy fruits."
France,Burgundy,Joseph Drouhin 2005  Chorey-lès-Beaune,Pinot Noir,88,29.0,"From one of the good value communes at the northern end of the Côte de Beaune, this Chorey is soft, juicy with strawberry flavors and framed by tannins. The acidity is there, but the effect is of a ripe, easy wine, ready to drink now."
France,Burgundy,Louis Latour 2005  Chassagne-Montrachet,Pinot Noir,88,30.0,"Densely tannic and firm, this wine has fresh acidity and red-plum-skin flavors. It is a solid, chunky wine, likely to age well, with a vibrant, juicy freshness in the aftertaste."
France,Burgundy,Corton André 2005  Gevrey-Chambertin,Pinot Noir,88,,"Powerful, ripe wine, plump and structured. There are fresh black cherries and plums and structure that promises some aging."
France,Burgundy,Corton André 2005 Les Damodes Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,88,,"Floral and aromatic, this wine is the opposite of the typical tannic Nuits-St.-Georges. It is lively, with vibrant red fruits, great rich black cherry flavors, with a light layer of tannin providing structure."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Perrot-Minot 2010 Vieilles Vignes  (Chambolle-Musigny),Pinot Noir,91,,"Using grapes sourced from 102-year-old vines, this is superripe and concentrated. Yet despite its richness, it has tight acidity that meshes with plum and damson fruits. Age for at least five years."
France,Burgundy,Domaines Devillard 2009 Château de Chamirey Les Cinq Premier Cru  (Mercurey),Pinot Noir,91,68.0,"Opulent and ripe, this is full of sweet red fruit, with tannins that have absorbed into the fruit. The wood aging acts as support to the rich texture. It is developing well, but could certainly age for four years or more."
France,Loire Valley,Château de Sancerre 2005  Sancerre,Pinot Noir,87,22.0,"An impressively rich Sancerre red, showing plenty of red berry fruits, tight tannins and balanced acidity. Yes, it is not Burgundy, but in 2005 Sancerre could really justify its red wines, and this example, with delicacy and elegance, works well."
France,Bordeaux,Domaines Lapalu 2008 La Patache  (Médoc),Cabernet Sauvignon,84,10.0,"Bright, fresh wine with a light wood touch. The acidity highlights black currant flavors exacerbated by some greenness."
France,Burgundy,Louis Latour 2015  Marsannay,Pinot Noir,88,28.0,This is ripe and fruity with attractive red-fruit flavors and a touch of tannins to keep it all in place. The wine is soft with just a layer of tannin and plenty of red cherries at the end.
France,Burgundy,Domaine des Croix 2014 Les Cent-Vignes Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,93,50.0,"While this wine is firm, with some fine tannins, it also has a pure line in fresh strawberry fruits that will develop as the tannins soften. This perfumed wine will develop slowly. Drink from 2020."
France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot 2014 Chaînes Carteaux Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,93,99.0,"From the southern part of Nuits-Saint-Georges, this small premier cru has produced a dark and structured wine with plenty of dry tannins that need to age.

France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot 2014 Les Chabiots Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny),Pinot Noir,93,140.0,"While this wine has generous swathes of ripe fruit, it also has plenty of the dark tannins that are found in the northern part of the appellation. It is dense in character, packed equally with concentrated tannins and with red-berry fruits. The wine will age well; drink from 2022."
France,Burgundy,Nicolas Potel 2014 Les Vaucrains Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,93,100.0,"From the southern part of Nuits-St-Georges, this ripe while structured wine has considerable potential. With its acidity, intense red-berry flavors and a firm background of tannins, it is poised for long aging. The toasty character needs to integrate with the fruit. Drink this impressive wine from 2020."
France,Burgundy,Chanson Père et Fils 2014  Givry,Pinot Noir,88,34.0,"This is a young, perfumed wine with attractive red fruits. While the wood is showing at the moment, that will fade as the wine develops, giving a fresh, raspberry-dominated wine. Drink from 2018."
France,Burgundy,L. Tramier & Fils 2015 Collection  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,88,83.0,"There is just a hint of the structure normally associated with the appellation. Otherwise, the wine is broad and soft with rounded berry and cherry flavors. It comes from vines on the flatter vineyards in the valley. It's a wine that will mature quickly. Drink from 2018."
France,Alsace,Domaine Charles Baur NV Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,90,27.0,"Creamy red apple notes dominate the nose and continue in this rich, biscuity way on the nose. This almost is a sublimation of shortcake with Red Delicious apples. The impression is made even stronger by the dryness and the structure, resulting in a fruity yet serious and very balanced wine."
France,Loire Valley,Xavier Flouret 2008 Rouge Noir  (Menetou-Salon),Pinot Noir,88,23.0,"Domaine de Chatenoy, in the same family for 15 generations, has produced this rich, full-flavored wine, packed with sweet strawberry and smooth tannins. It could age, but is ready to drink now."
France,Southwest France,Cave du Marmandais 2015 Richard 1er Red (Côtes du Marmandais),Red Blend,86,13.0,"The Abouriou, which forms a small part of the blend of this wine, is one of those many Southwest grapes that has been rescued from a sad decline. It adds a richly perfumed character to the Bordeaux blend in this grape. Attractive, with young tannins and ripe black fruits, it will age well. Drink from 2018."
France,Provence,Rimauresq 2006 Cru Classé Red (Côtes de Provence),Red Blend,86,23.0,Raspberry and earth tones open this medium-weight Provence blend. There's cherry fruit and a moderate level of complexity on the palate but also a slightly funky note in the background. Tannins are forceful but polite; try with pork roast.
France,Burgundy,Domaine de Bellene 2010 Vieilles Vignes  (Côtes de Nuits Villages),Pinot Noir,89,58.0,"This has weight and ripe plum and damson flavors that are now integrating into the tannins. It's worth aging for a few years, but it is already enjoyable."
France,Burgundy,Jaffelin 2009 Les Grandes Vignes Premier Cru  (Givry),Pinot Noir,89,32.0,"Although this has a rustic edge, this is an attractive, ripe and red-fruited wine.

France,Burgundy,L. Tramier & Fils 2010 Collection Premier Cru  (Volnay),Pinot Noir,89,79.0,"This full-bodied wine demonstrates the jammy side of Volnay. It is rich and dense, and it has a delicious berry flavor. In the process of all this generosity, the tannins are lost, so drink it over the next few years."
France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot 2010 Les Peuillets Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,89,,"Rich and broad, this is packed with dense fruit and tannins. It is ripe and full bodied, two qualities that are derived from the warm vineyard. The finish shows juicy acidity."
France,Southwest France,Jean-Luc Baldès 2014 Clos Triguedina Red (Cahors),Red Blend,91,34.0,"The Occitan origin of this estate's name, me trigo da dina, means “longing to dine,” and this richly endowed wine satisfies its remit. It has plenty of young tannins, which are sustained by ripe, juicy black fruit and ample acidity. Blending the three Cahors red grapes—Malbec, Merlot and Tannat—has made a wine with a fine future. Drink from 2019."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Poulleau Père et Fils 2011 La Grande Châtelaine  (Côte de Beaune),Pinot Noir,87,,"Attractive, wood and yellow fruit laden wine. It's soft, rounded with bright acidity and a spicy character. It's wood probably needs to soften over the next few months."
France,Burgundy,Nuiton-Beaunoy 2011 Les Dames Huguettes  (Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Nuits),Pinot Noir,87,20.0,"Structured and fruity, this is a wine that shows the delicate perfumed character of the Hautes Côtes. The wine has bright raspberry fruits, balanced acidity and just the right amount of structure for aging for a year."
France,Burgundy,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2012 Les Dames Huguettes  (Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Nuits),Pinot Noir,85,42.0,"A light-colored wine, this reflects the cool character of the Hautes Côtes. The result is a wine that's stalky, fruity and layered with acidity. It has a lightly strawberry, juicy aftertaste. Drink from 2015."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Faiveley 2009 Les Cazetiers Premier Cru  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,92,100.0,"There is a lot of power in this wine. It has great weight and richness and an intense structure. Hanging from the frame of the wine are dark plum fruits, layers of wood, sweet spice, complex acidity and dry tannins. Age for 6–7 years."
France,Burgundy,Louis Jadot 2009  Vosne-Romanée,Pinot Noir,92,56.0,"Very structured, as befits a Vosne-Romanée, even a village wine. The black cherry fruit and layered acidity are combined with a firm and dry tannic core. There is power here, and some aging potential."
France,Loire Valley,Daniel Chotard 2014 Le Chant de l'Archet  (Sancerre),Pinot Noir,93,35.0,"A selection of old vines and 12 months of barrel aging have produced a ripe, full and spicy wine.

France,Southwest France,Domaine Rotier 2006 Renaissance Red (Gaillac),Red Blend,91,23.0,"Blending Duras, Braucol and Syrah, this is a powerful wine, perfumed and dominated by tannins from fruit and wood.

France,Champagne,Dautel-Cadot NV Grande Tradition Blanc de Noirs Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,87,35.0,"From the Aube region in the south of Champagne, this is a rich and soft wine, on the sweet side for a Brut. It has a warm feeling to it, ripe and with apricot and apple fruit flavors. Rounded and full in the mouth, it is ready to drink."
France,Southwest France,Domaine Rotier 2008 L'Ame Red (Gaillac),Red Blend,93,,"A blend of Duras and Braucol, grapes local to Gaillac, this wine is named after the spirit (Ame) of wine. Showing the potential of red Gaillac, this is a beautifully balanced and concentrated wine, with tannins that are already well integrated into the wood and sweet fruits. Age for 4–6 years, but can be drunk sooner."
France,Burgundy,Joseph Drouhin 2010  Rully,Pinot Noir,87,26.0,"Taut, tannic and nervy, this has red currant fruit that gives a crisp sensation to this tight, precise wine. Give it a year to soften."
France,Loire Valley,Roger et Didier Raimbault 2013  Sancerre,Pinot Noir,92,40.0,"This really elegant Pinot Noir has good color as well as a perfumed, aromatic character. The fruit is ripe cherries, supported by a light tannic layer. Acidity gives this wine freshness as well as suggesting that it could age. Drink from 2017."
France,France Other,Lionel Osmin & Cie 2013 Villa de Cocagne Red (Vin de France),Red Blend,87,12.0,"Drawing a blend of Merlot, Tannat and Syrah from several regions in southwest France, this soft and fruity wine is light with a juicy mix of acidity and dry tannins. Berry fruits and a fresh aftertaste suggest it is ready to drink now."
France,Alsace,Allimant-Laugner NV Rosé Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,88,20.0,"The nose hovers somewhere between pink grapefruit and Cox Orange Pippin apple: that is to say the flavors are pure, fruity and crisp. The palate is dry and aromatic, fizzy and easy, foaming and light. This is an ideal party wine, enlivening everything with its weightless freshness."
France,Alsace,Zusslin 2013 Brut Zéro Rosé Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,93,35.0,"The faintest note of caramel precedes hints of baked red apples. This is soft and generous, mellow and smooth, supported by very fine mousse and pervaded by subtle freshness. All the structure and richness of Pinot Noir are evident in this elegant rosé. Its purity and poise is outstanding, its flavors linger and last. This is immensely rich yet slender: clearly the art of zero-dosage has been mastered here completely."
France,Burgundy,Château Philippe-le-Hardi 2009 Clos du Roi Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,88,,"Dense, rich and ripe, this has some tannic structure, but it's less salient compared to the ripe fruit, soft texture and juicy acidity. This wine can age, although it is already showing fruitiness."
France,Burgundy,Olivier Leflaive 2010  Côte de Beaune-Villages,Pinot Noir,88,80.0,"Ripe and fruity, but also structured, this has fine acidity with a hint of wood. The main thrust of the wine is its raspberry, plum and damson fruits. The finish has a lively feel."
France,Burgundy,Labouré-Roi 2014 Clos Rousseau Premier Cru  (Santenay),Pinot Noir,87,35.0,"This wine has structure and strong old-wood flavors. It comes from the most southerly Premier Cru in the Côte de Beaune, close to the Chalonnaise vineyards. The fruit is still working its way through the tannins of this firm wine. It will have a juicy red-berry character as it develops, giving the potential for aging. Drink from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Louis Max 2009 Domaine de la Créa Sous Roche  (Saint-Romain),Pinot Noir,87,,"A fruity wine—this is full of strawberry flavor, with enough acidity and soft, warm tannins to give it shape. While it can age, it is ready to drink now."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Jessiaume 2009 Les Ecusseaux Premier Cru  (Auxey-Duresses),Pinot Noir,87,46.0,"Wood-influenced aromas set the scene, with the wine's toast character partnered with ripe red fruits and taut acidity. It needs at least three years to balance out."
France,Champagne,Tendil & Lombardi 2007 Rosé de Saignée Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,88,69.0,"A rare rosé Champagne whose color comes from Pinot Noir skins rather than from added red wine, this has vivid colors of orange and onion skin. It is rich, tasting as much like wine as like sparkling wine, with a full and ripe, yet dry, feel."
France,Champagne,Tendil & Lombardi NV Blanc de Noirs Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,88,59.0,"This dry, 100% Pinot Noir Champagne has tense acidity as well as crisp apple- and citrus-driven acidity. With its taut mineral character, it needs at least a year to soften."
France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Diví Elegància NV Tuilé Red (Rivesaltes),Red Blend,89,18.0,"Burnt brown sugar, caramel sauce, baked plum, fig and milk chocolate abound on the nose of this rich, decadent selection. Well balanced and incredibly easy to like, lush dark-fruit flavors lead the medium-weight palate, while notes of milk chocolate and baking spice linger on the close."
France,Burgundy,Louis Latour 2011 Les Damodes Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,90,85.0,"Firm in its tannins and with a sense of power, this full-bodied wine has great fruit, along with wood and licorice flavors.

France,Burgundy,Domaine des Comtes Lafon 2007 Clos des Chênes Premier Cru  (Volnay),Pinot Noir,93,,"Rich, soft and gentle, with light tannins, ripe fruit and a pronounced freshness, touched with black cherry. This is not for long-term aging, but it's worth waiting for 2–3 years."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Henri Gouges 2007 Les St.-Georges Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,93,,"A wine that is ripe and relatively soft. It does offer some dense tannins, but these are surrounded by rich black plum and ripe berry fruits. The structure comes from wood aging and fruit as much as from tannins. The final flavors are delicious, smoky and toasty."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Parent 2003 Les Epenots Premier Cru  (Pommard),Pinot Noir,93,,"Very soft, very ripe and generous, the tannins showing but surrounded by fruit flavors that are now morphing into more herbal, tarry, mushroom flavors. The final spice character gives a great complementary burst of taste."
France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot 2008 Domaine du Clos Frantin Aux Malconsorts Premier Cru  (Vosne-Romanée),Pinot Noir,93,,"Spicy, rich and concentrated, the important element of acidity working with the ripeness of the juicy black fruits. The wine has density, pushing tannins through to the ripe fruits. It shows a dry element that will take time to integrate."
France,Burgundy,Chanson Père et Fils 2007 Clos des Mouches Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,93,,"A dense and serious wine, layering acidity with tight tannins. Under this surface firmness, the red-berry fruit is sumptuous with great juicy freshness. It is a great bringing together of structure, roundness and lively acidity."
France,Burgundy,Domaine de Montille 2007 Les Rugiens Premier Cru  (Pommard),Pinot Noir,93,,"An elegant style, showing a fresh character, packed with red berries, softly textured.

France,Champagne,Fluteau NV Brut Blanc de Noirs Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,90,50.0,"Made mainly from Pinot Noir, this is a full wine, intensely fruity and ripe. Apple and sweet lime flavors give a rich feeling, while a touch of minerality adds the proper texture and balance. Drink now."
France,Loire Valley,Joseph Mellot 2015 Domaine des Emois  (Sancerre),Pinot Noir,88,30.0,"Rich and fruity, this wine full of black-cherry and red-plum flavors. There is no wood aging, just fruit and crisp acidity that between them fill out the lightly tannic texture. Drink this wine from 2018."
France,France Other,L. Tramier & Fils 2016 Tramier Pinot Noir (Vin de France),Pinot Noir,88,10.0,"This sophisticated and stylish Pinot Noir from the south of France was made a Burgundy producer. It has fine tannins, juicy red cherry-driven acidity and a warm, ripe aftertaste."

There's great potential here, the ripe fruits just showing their intensity, but for the moment, the tannins are the core."
France,Burgundy,Bouchard Père & Fils 2005  Monthélie,Pinot Noir,90,33.0,"An opulent style, where the tannins are subservient to the ripeness of the red cherry flavor. The acidity enhances the sweetness of the rich fruit, and the lively, vibrant texture comes sweeping right through to finish."
France,Burgundy,Corton André 2005 Clos de la Commaraine Premier Cru  (Pommard),Pinot Noir,90,,"Very Pommard, very structured, this is a dense and dark wine that shows big black fruits over dry tannins. It's big, firm, muscular, a powerhouse of firmness and richness."
France,Burgundy,Domaine des Lambrays 2005  Clos de Lambrays,Pinot Noir,98,,"A beautiful, pure wine that  combines freshness and intense richness. It seems to float while still giving a huge mouthful of plums, coffee and sweet, juicy tannins. A straight line of pure flavor all the way to the finish."
France,Burgundy,Louis Jadot 2005  Charmes-Chambertin,Pinot Noir,98,134.0,"A complete wine. As it starts in the mouth, there is a feeling of everything in its place. The tannins are initially soft, dusty rather than dry; then the dark plums, red berries and so-sweet strawberries come into play. And finally, they all come together in a climax of richness and freshness."
France,Burgundy,Louis Jadot 2005  Clos de la Roche,Pinot Noir,98,138.0,"This is a powerhouse of a wine. It is driven forward by immense tannins as well as by superrich fruit that still keeps itself in check by a velvet texture. There is spice, acidity, some toast and vanilla, and finally a sunburst of warmth."
France,Burgundy,Louis Jadot 2005  Corton-Pougets,Pinot Noir,97,95.0,"A supremely integrated wine, its richness and beautiful fruit just part of a story that starts with intense aromas and segues on the palate into a balance of tannins, dark red fruits, enveloping acidity and a beautifully orchestrated finale of berries, spice and aching freshness."
France,Burgundy,Louis Jadot 2005 Clos Saint Jacques Premier Cru  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,96,125.0,"Beautiful, aromatic wine, with raspberry fruit floating above the spice and toast.

France,Burgundy,Domaine de l'Arlot 2005  Romanée-St.-Vivant,Pinot Noir,95,,"Domaine de l'Arlot owns just over one acre of this grand cru vineyard in Vosne-Romanée. This 2005 shows intense, complex fruits and tannins, both finely intertwined. There is power, but the strawberry flavors are just as important, flattering the palate."
France,Burgundy,Louis Jadot 2005 Les Baudes Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny),Pinot Noir,95,90.0,"Opulent yet so elegant, this wine has already achieved great balance. It comes from the soft richness of the generous fruit, the spice from both the wood and the fruit, and the roundness of the texture, which envelops you in its warmth and ripeness. And, at the end, just to give a great lift, along comes the acidity."
France,Burgundy,Nuiton-Beaunoy 2014 Clos du Chapitre Premier Cru  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,91,90.0,"The fruit and structure of this monopole bottling from Nuiton-Beanoy are already well integrated.

France,Burgundy,Nuiton-Beaunoy 2014 Les Sionnières  (Morey-Saint-Denis),Pinot Noir,91,60.0,"Showing plenty of the concentration this village can produce, this wine from a small parcel is structured to age. It's rich while keeping the acidity and crispness of the year in mind. Drink from 2021."
France,France Other,Barton & Guestier 2016 Bistro Pinot Noir (Vin de France),Pinot Noir,86,12.0,"This ripe, cherry-flavored wine has touches of toasty spice from wood aging. It's smooth and soft, with juicy acidity that offsets its rounded texture."

France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Les Jamelles 2007 Pinot Noir (Vin de Pays de L'Aude),Pinot Noir,84,10.0,Both the gorgeous purple color and the nose of fresh grapes make this wine a dead ringer for Beaujolais. The soft palate shows notes of sweet strawberries but has sufficient acidity to leave a refreshing impression in the mouth. Drink now.
France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Lorgeril 2005 La Combe Des Oliviers Red (Corbières),Red Blend,84,13.0,"Starts off with a bit of a sweaty funk that soon blows off and allows more pleasant notes of bay leaves, thyme, red currant and rhubarb to come through. A touch sanguine and mulchy in the mouth with lighter body and acidity."
France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Les Jamelles 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Vin de Pays d'Oc),Cabernet Sauvignon,84,10.0,"Lovely cassis and jam scents are hampered by some slight musty aromas, which eventually give way to a blast of black licorice. Burnt sugar and cassis dominate the soft, sweetish palate that offers just a bit of grip. The short finish is reminiscent of a raspberry cordial. Drink up."
France,Southwest France,Château Bellevue la Forêt 2007 Cuvée BLF Red (Fronton),Red Blend,84,11.0,"There is a barnyard feel to this wine, from its rustic aromas through the edgy berry fruit to the final flavors of acidity and beetroot. The character gives licorice and spice as well as blackberry fruits."

Its dark color and blackberry perfume promises a rich, complex palate. It's serious—densely packed with both tannins and opulent fruit. Drink from 2019."
France,Southwest France,Domaine Rotier 2015 Renaissance Red (Gaillac),Red Blend,93,23.0,"This wine comes from the stony slopes above the river Tarn, 45 minutes northeast of Toulouse. That gives it its strongly mineral texture and powerful tannins. A blend of rare and local Duras, Braucol and Prunelard grapes, it's firm and structured while also full of great black fruit and potential. Drink from 2021."
France,Champagne,Dautel-Cadot NV Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,84,59.0,A dark color with light orange flecks leads to a wine that is fruity while feeling heavy. It has ripe strawberry flavors and a caramel character that doesn't lie with the final acidity.
France,Southwest France,Château Coutinel 2014 Grande Réserve Red (Fronton),Red Blend,92,45.0,"From old vines and aged in wood for nine months, this rich blend that is dominated by the local Negrette grape is balanced and packed with fruit. There are touches of violet and exotic spices as well as berry fruits. The wine is still young and should age. It's a shame about the unnecessarily heavy bottle. Drink from 2019."
France,Burgundy,Dujac Fils & Pere 2014  Chambolle-Musigny,Pinot Noir,92,80.0,This negociant wine produced by Domaine Dujac has plenty of the generous fruit associated with the appellation. It also has solid tannins built for aging and strikes a fine balance between the crisp character of its red fruit and richer wood spice notes. Drink from 2019.
France,Burgundy,Bailly-Lapierre NV Brut  (Crémant de Bourgogne),Pinot Noir,90,25.0,"Rich and full in mouthfeel, this wine is maturing well, giving some suggestions of bottle age alongside ripe pear and apple flavors. The acidity is still fresh, resulting in a crisp, tight finish. Drink now."
France,Burgundy,Bouchard Père & Fils 2007 Les Porrets Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,92,,"Tough and defiantly tannic, a hard-edged wine that gives a powerful dry texture. The fruit is less obvious, but has a potential to offer red fruits and fresh acidity. This does need aging, over 4–5 years."
France,Burgundy,Bouchard Père & Fils 2007 Les Suchots Premier Cru  (Vosne-Romanée),Pinot Noir,92,149.0,"Fine ripe fruit here, with soft, sweet berries and surprisingly smooth tannins. The wine is rich, not heavyweight, but glorying in the opulence of Pinot Noir. The finish brings on the tannins again."
France,Burgundy,Bouchard Père & Fils 2007 Taillepieds Premier Cru  (Volnay),Pinot Noir,92,69.0,"Solid, foursquare wine, full of structure and fruit, bringing light tannins into play with black plums and sweet acidity. But the wine also has a lightness of touch, offering approachability as well as concentration. Age for 3–4 years."
France,Burgundy,Manuel Olivier 2007  Gevrey-Chambertin,Pinot Noir,91,50.0,"A rich wine that shows the power of Gevrey, even in a lesser vintage. The fruit fills the glass with aromas of red plums, sweet raspberries and cranberry juice. There is spice here along with juicy fresh acidity. It is worth aging 3–4 years, but is delicious now."
France,Burgundy,Roux Père et Fils 2006 Les Petits Vougeots Premier Cru  (Vougeot),Pinot Noir,91,,"From the Roux family's own vines in Vougeot, this is an intense statement of dark tannins and firm fruit. The wine sits solidly in the glass, giving a dry core, surrounded by sweet plum juice flavors. In 5–6 years, it will have developed well."
France,Alsace,Joseph Cattin 2013 Steinbach Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,92,45.0,"A whole host of aromas interest here: black and red cherry, fresh earth, lifted conifer and a touch of mocha. The palate is concentrated and has a lovely texture of starched velvet. This echoes aromatically and has a vein of brightening freshness at its core. There is warmth and a huge generosity of fruit that is utterly moreish."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Chevillon-Chezeaux 2014 Les Bousselots Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,92,70.0,"On one of the many steep slopes above Nuits Saint-Georges, this vineyard produces wines with much of the classic structure of the appellation. This is rich, full of firm tannins and with a solid structure and future. Blackberry flavors are dark and intense and the wine needs time. Drink from 2019."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Henri Delagrange 2014 Les Vaumuriens Hauts  (Pommard),Pinot Noir,92,64.0,"Vines grown on thin soil close to the stony subsoil produce this tight, taught and mineral wine. With acidity, structured tannins and concentration, the wine is still starting out. It is a dark wine with black fruits that need time to fully develop. Drink this intense wine from 2020."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Huguenot 2014 Les Crais  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,92,70.0,This wine comes from village appellation vineyards. It is soft and without the powerful tannins often found in the area. It compensates with dark berry fruits and some ripe tannins that are finely integrated into the wine. Acidity at the end adds to the potential of this wine which will be best from 2019.
France,Burgundy,Domaines Devillard 2014 Château de Chamirey Clos l'Evêque Premier Cru  (Mercurey),Pinot Noir,92,50.0,"This Premier Cru vineyard is on a high point in the village. It has produced a rich fruity wine with great structure and dense tannins. Bold red fruits are dominant with the acidity in a supporting role. The wine is rich, full and needing to age. Drink this wine from 2018."
France,Loire Valley,Roger et Didier Raimbault 2007  Sancerre,Pinot Noir,85,,"A soft, earthy wine, with light strawberry jelly Pinot Noir flavors and a gentle series of tannins. The edge on this wine comes from the fresh acidity that brings out the lightweight final texture."
France,Alsace,Joseph Cattin 2012 Steinbach Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,87,50.0,"A very smoky nose is reminsicent of mocha. This oaky spice is also very evident on the light, red-fruited body. There is a bitter edge to the soft tannins but also a warm finish."
France,Champagne,Drappier NV Pinot Noir Zéro Dosage Brut Nature Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,90,,"Taking his practice of bottling with as little sulfur as possible to its logical conclusion, André Drappier has bottled this wine with no sulfur at all. It's a brave wine, and one where the risk is justified. It is full, very pure in the mouth, full of delicious lemon zest and grapefruit, but rounded out considerably, the fruit right up there. Drink now, is Drappier's advice—not hard to take."
France,Burgundy,Château de Chamirey 2008 Les Ruelles Premier Cru  (Mercurey),Pinot Noir,90,57.0,"Owned by the Devillard family, Château de Chamirey produces firmly textured wines. This Mercurey is on the dry side, while not losing sight of fresh red-berry fruits and bright acidity."
France,Burgundy,Joseph Drouhin 2007 Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny),Pinot Noir,90,85.0,"Finely perfumed, a wine that has some elegant structure, sweet red-berry fruits and a light acidity. The texture is gentle, soft and rounded, ready to drink now."
France,Burgundy,Capitain-Gagnerot 2013  Echézeaux,Pinot Noir,94,139.0,"This producer, based in Ladoix-Serrigny in the Côte de Beaune also has a small parcel in this Grand Cru in Vosne-Romanée. Like all this producer's wines it was fermented in open tanks before barrel aging. That gives an extra concentration to the ripe fruits and firm tannins. It is an opulent wine, juicy with black fruits and acidity. With its structure, it will certainly age further, so drink from 2019."
France,Burgundy,Domaine de Bellene 2014 Cuvée du Cinquantenaire Vieilles Vignes Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,94,100.0,"This blend from five Beaune Premier Crus was made to celebrate the Potel family's 50 years in wine. It is a richly structured, beautiful wine with its dark tannins and black fruit showing so well. Concentrated from the low yielding old vines, the wine is packed with fruits and acidity that are developing slowly. Drink from 2020."
France,Burgundy,Domaine de Bellene 2014 Les Grèves Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,94,86.0,"This wine comes from perhaps the most well-known of the many Beaune Premier Crus, from a small parcel of vines that are over 100 years old.

France,Burgundy,Domaine Henri Delagrange 2014 Les Bertins Premier Cru  (Pommard),Pinot Noir,94,104.0,"The Bertins Premier Cru vineyard is on the southern Volnay side of Pommard, giving a comparatively soft generous style of wine.

France,Burgundy,Domaine Henri Delagrange 2014 Santenots Premier Cru  (Volnay),Pinot Noir,94,145.0,"Vines planted in 1939 by the current winemaker's grandfather give an impressively ripe wine. It is dense with concentrated tannins, smoky red fruits and still youthful acidity. The wine has a bold juicy character that comes from the open-tank fermentation giving great fruitiness. Drink this wine from 2020."
France,Burgundy,Domaines Devillard 2014 Domaine des Perdrix Aux Perdrix Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,94,100.0,"The Devillards own 99% of this 8.5-acre Premier Cru and so feel they can describe it as a quasi-monopoly. Vines dating back to 1922 give immense concentration as well as rich black fruits. The wine is spicy with a strongly mineral texture, red-berry fruits and black cherries. It is a wine for aging, so drink from 2022."
France,Loire Valley,Domaine Cordaillat 2014 Cuvée Dagobert Pinot Noir (Reuilly),Pinot Noir,88,18.0,"Named after one of the Merovingian kings of the Franks (7th century), this wine is somewhat more modern in style than that. In fact with its ripe red and black-cherry fruits and balanced, smoky tannins, it's a wine to drink now. It will age though, until 2020."
France,Loire Valley,Domaine Jean Teiller 2014  Menetou-Salon,Pinot Noir,88,23.0,"This is a fruity, lightly structured wine. With perfumed red berries and tight acidity, it is all about fruitiness and freshness. It needs to fill out and to become as rich as its potential suggests. Drink from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot 2010 Domaine du Clos Frantin Les Murots  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,90,,"Packed with ripe black- and red-fruit flavors, this wine is dense and concentrated. The rich, generous fruit comes with a complex minerally edge, and it shows the wood influence in the form of a spice note. Age this at least six years."
France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot 2010 Domaine du Pavillon Les Santenots Premier Cru  (Volnay),Pinot Noir,90,,"Typical of Volnay, this wine has a velvety character that surrounds the firm tannins. The acidity is palpable through the warm red-berry flavors and firm edge. It is certainly a wine for aging, although it is also likely to be drinkable in 2–3 years."
France,Burgundy,Jaffelin 2010  Gevrey-Chambertin,Pinot Noir,90,50.0,"Powerful and finely structured, this rich wine has swathes of red plum and red berry flavors that balance the core of solid tannins. It shows the ripe fruit and structure of the vintage. Age this for 2–3 years."
France,Burgundy,Jaffelin 2010 Les Cent Vignes Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,90,55.0,"Rich, round and complex, this is full of ripe red-berry flavors. The acidity drives the solid tannins and firm structure. The wine has the approachability of Beaune, but it can also be aged for 4–5 years."
France,Burgundy,Joseph Faiveley 2010  Chambolle-Musigny,Pinot Noir,90,95.0,"Smooth and rich, this generous selection is full of ripe fruit and balanced tannins. It shows the elegant side of village wines. With delicious acidity on the finish, this wine can be consumed soon, although it will also age well for several years."
France,Southwest France,Château de Saurs 2008 Red (Gaillac),Red Blend,87,,"In an earthy, rather rustic style, this is a wine whose lack of polish is made up for by its hearty berry fruits that blossom in the glass."
France,Loire Valley,Emile Balland 2014 Les Beaux Jours Red (Coteaux du Giennois),Red Blend,86,20.0,"The vineyard of the Giennois is close to the city of Orléans, making it the most northerly Loire vineyard. This wine with its cool, fresh character has a light tannic character and brings out red fruits as its biggest attraction. It has a fresh, crisp, juicy aftertaste. Drink now."
France,Loire Valley,Pierre Morin 2014  Sancerre,Pinot Noir,89,25.0,"Partly aged in wood, this ripe, full wine has rich cherry fruits and some balanced tannins. It's a structured wine while also juicy and with good acidity. It needs to age another few months, so drink from the end of 2017."
France,Provence,Mas de Gourgonnier 2010 Réserve du Mas Red (Les Baux de Provence),Red Blend,92,,"This is a perfumed wine that has immediately attractive herbal aromas. It is warm, ripe and full bodied with a dense texture full of red fruits, lavender and herbes de Provence. This wine should not be drunk before 2015."
France,Burgundy,Laleure-Piot 1998 Premier Cru Les Vergelesses  (Pernand-Vergelesses),Pinot Noir,92,33.0,"Exemplary in all areas, from the smoke, mushroom and berry nose to the exotic undertones of island spice and fine oak supporting vibrant raspberry fruit. It's one of those wines that's a pure pleasure to drink, and it's ready out of the gate. For very good Burgundy that clicks on all cylinders, this is it."
France,Southwest France,Domaine du Moulin 2012 Red (Gaillac),Red Blend,86,12.0,"Blending Duras and Syrah indicates how Gaillac is at the median point between the Atlantic and Mediterranean climates in France.

France,Burgundy,Olivier Leflaive 2009  Bourgogne,Pinot Noir,88,27.0,"A rich and fruity wine with an attractive layer of tannins to go with the bright red cherry and damson flavors. The fruit is delicious, succulent, finishing with fine acidity."
France,Burgundy,Pierre André 2009  Savigny-lès-Beaune,Pinot Noir,88,,"A perfumed wine, deliciously accessible now. The damson and red plum fruits push through a light tannic core. It's a wine with a pure Pinot character, very linear and ready to drink."
France,Burgundy,Roux Père et Fils 2010 La Perrière  (Mercurey),Pinot Noir,87,,"A wine relatively high in red-currant-like acidity. It does have a rustic side to it, although the fruit has potential richness and should come through in 2–3 years."
France,Burgundy,Maison Champy 2008 Vieilles Vignes  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,87,,"With many Champy reds, the high toast extract is just a hint. Here it dominates. While there is acidity and a bitter cherry flavor, it is hard to discern through the barrier of wood. Maybe two or three years will help, but it is a question."
France,Burgundy,Vignerons de Buxy 2015 Buissonnier  (Mercurey),Pinot Noir,87,20.0,"With judicious wood aging, this is a rich wine.

Its cooler climate produces lighter wines, although in this warm vintage this is ripe style of wine. With its red-berry fruits and juicy acidity, the light tannins just give structure to a wine that is ready to drink."
France,Southwest France,Château Bellevue la Forêt 2009 Optimum Red (Fronton),Red Blend,90,25.0,"A rich and jammy wine that has ripe tannins that form a backdrop to the generous black fruits. Produced from old vines, the wine shows a rich and concentrated character. The aftertaste is punctuated by fresh acidity."
France,Southwest France,Château Coutinel 2011 Quintessence Red (Fronton),Red Blend,90,25.0,"While Négrette dominates this blend, the addition of Cabernet and Syrah gives an extra ripe complexity, while adding sinews to the structure. Red berry fruits and a fresh layer of acidity are added to the oak from the barrique aging. Drink from 2016."
France,Alsace,Cave de Ribeauvillé 2013 Rodern Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,86,26.0,"Red plum and strawberry compote rise faintly from the glass. The palate is fruity but dilute, easy and clean. Drink soon and possibly chilled a little to accentuate the freshness."
France,Alsace,Domaine Fernand Engel 2014 Tradition Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,86,19.0,A closed nose gives little away of the conifer and pine notes that seem to spice this wine. It has aromas of oak and some cinnamon but fruit never makes it to the fore.
France,Burgundy,Pierre Morey 2005 Grands Epenots Premier Cru  (Pommard),Pinot Noir,94,95.0,"A beautiful rounded wine, full of juicy fruit, but sustained by a strong tannic structure. This dryness suggests good aging potential, as does the ripeness of the fruit and the acidity. Keep for at least 6 years."
France,Burgundy,Jean-Claude Boisset 2005  Chambertin,Pinot Noir,93,169.0,"A round, full-bodied wine that goes for the generous, opulent fruity aspect of red Burgundy with its big, blowsy red fruits, just kept in check by tannins. The acidity is lively and fresh, keeping pace with the intense vibrant fruits. Screwcap."
France,Burgundy,Jean-Claude Boisset 2005  Echézeaux,Pinot Noir,93,115.0,"An impressive wine, fueled by black plum juice flavors. The acidity is just right, balancing the richness of the fruit. The wine revels in the serious side of Echezeaux, packed with dark, tight tannins over the fruit. It needs at least five years, maybe 10."
France,France Other,Clos Teddi 2015 Red (Patrimonio),Red Blend,86,,"This ripe, spicy blend of Niellucciu and Grenache has a rich while also fruity character. The tannins are generous, warm and allow the fruit and acidity to express themselves. It will be ready to drink from 2017."
France,Burgundy,Louis Jadot 2013 Clos des Ursules Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,95,93.0,"This Beaune bottling has a dense structure that broods through its tannic outer skin.

France,Burgundy,Louis Jadot 2013 Lavaux Saint-Jacques Premier Cru  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,95,135.0,"Severe and austere at this stage, this solid, dark wine has all the weight of a wine from Gevrey, concentrated and densely tannic.

The structure is all there with some solid tannins although the wine also has superripe red fruits that are delicious and jammy. Full in the mouth, it is still young, so drink from 2019."
France,Burgundy,Joseph Drouhin 2012 Procès Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,94,117.0,"The first things to notice are the tannins with a strongly dry core.

France,Burgundy,Meurgey-Croses 2015 Les Grands Epenots Premier Cru  (Pommard),Pinot Noir,92,95.0,"The wine has barnyard aromas that need to blow off.

France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Abbaye De Tholomies 2005 Red (Minervois),Red Blend,87,17.0,"This wine appears to need a bit more time to come fully into its own. Tight and dark with notes of blackberries, plum skin, burnt coffee residue and herbs, the full mouth is overcome by firm tannins on the finish, preventing much else from coming through on the end. Some aging (try at least a year) should bring things into balance."
France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot 2015 Clos de l'Ermitage  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,89,48.0,"Showing a dry character from the wood aging, this spicy wine also has fruit weight. While it is still young, its ripe berry flavors laced with black cherries are right up front. It does have the rounded character of a Beaune and this will develop more strongly. Drink from 2021."
France,Burgundy,Domaine d'Ardhuy 2015 Aux Clous Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,89,,"Soft and aromatic, the wine is fruity with open tannins and plenty of acidity. It is smooth and developing quickly, showing its red-currant fruit. Drink from 2019."

France,Loire Valley,Fournier Père et Fils 2009 Les Belles Vignes Rosé Pinot Noir (Sancerre),Pinot Noir,88,26.0,"The crispness and acidity are very evident in this bright, fresh, strawberry-flavored wine. Drink soon for its delicious liveliness."
France,Burgundy,Louis Max 2009 Clos des Chênes  (Volnay),Pinot Noir,88,44.0,"This is firm, showing a ripe plum-skin flavor and a severe line of tannin. There's some bitterness along with a good depth of fruit flavor, structure and acidity, all of which suggest aging potential."
France,Burgundy,Louis Max 2010 Domaine de la Créa Les Grands Picotins  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,88,29.0,"A rounded, wood-aged wine, this is full of ripe red-berry and spice flavors, with a core of warm, smoky tannins. It is structured and should age over several years."
France,Southwest France,Domaine Rotier 2010 L'Ame Red (Gaillac),Red Blend,94,,"Dark and powerful, this is a complex and concentrated wood-aged wine. It's a blend of two local Gaillac grapes, Duras and Braucol, which gives richness, structure and a dense, herbal character. This wine, with its long term future, is still young, showing as much tannin as fruit, so don't drink before 2016."
France,Southwest France,Domaine Rotier 2011 Renaissance Red (Gaillac),Red Blend,93,25.0,"Rotier's top wine is an impressive, wood-aged example of how good red Gaillac can be. This spicy, black-fruited wine is packed with dark cherries, plums and dusty tannins. It needs to age even more, so drink this solid, long-lasting wine from 2018."
France,Southwest France,Château Tour des Gendres 2016 Vigne d'Albert Red (Bergerac),Red Blend,87,17.0,"Named after the grandfather of the estate's present owners, this is a weird and wonderful blend that mixes the grapes of Bordeaux, Gaillac and places in between. Bottled without sulfur, it's fruity and juicy, with a strong edge of pepper and a touch of barnyard. Drink now."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Jayer-Gilles 2007  Côte de Nuits-Villages,Pinot Noir,87,68.0,"A darkly tannic wine, showing a dry side of Pinot Noir but still offering some good berry fruits and raspberry sweetness. The acidity needs to soften, though."
France,Southwest France,Producteurs Plaimont 2007 Collection Plaimont Red (Madiran),Red Blend,91,18.0,"The aroma is earthy, while on the palate this wine shows a full-bodied structure and rich, chewy black fruits. There is minerality here, a very textured wine offering spice as well as blackberry and plum-skin flavors."
France,France Other,Henri Milan 2007 Le Vallon Red (Vin de Table Francais),Red Blend,91,28.0,"A rich wine, perfumed and intense. The tannins are a major element, although they ride with the sweet fruit and concentrated, complex wood and acidity. The wine is firm, impressively fruity and still likely to age further."
France,Burgundy,Château de Santenay 2014 Le Bois de Lalier  (Mercurey),Pinot Noir,88,35.0,"With big holdings in the appellation, the Château de Santenay produces a range of wines. This single-vineyard bottling is typically rich and rounded. It cushions the tannins with ripe fruit and gentle acidity. Developing well, the wine will be ready to drink from 2017."
France,France Other,Michel Gassier 2014 Les Piliers Cabernet Sauvignon (Vin de France),Cabernet Sauvignon,88,17.0,"An attractive and ripely fruited Cab, this opens with lush aromas of blackberry, raspberry preserves and black plum that are complemented by spicy notes of bittersweet chocolate, toasted oak, pepper and cigar-box spice. The plush mouthfeel offers medium tannins and dense black-fruit flavors that linger on the spicy finish."
France,Burgundy,Nuiton-Beaunoy 2011  Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Nuits,Pinot Noir,84,16.0,"Light colored wine with a touch of smokiness and soft, ripe fruits. It lacks definition, giving an open feeling without much structure. Wood aging gives a burnt character at the end."
France,Provence,Château Routas 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Vin de Pays Var),Cabernet Sauvignon,88,,"Cabernet Sauvignon in Provence seems to evoke the herbal wild-thyme character of the countryside. This wine has weight to its black fruit flavors, with an edge from its tannins and acidity. It could age for 2–3 years. Screwcap."
France,Provence,Domaine de la Grande Séouve 2006 Saint-Aix Red (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence),Red Blend,85,18.0,"Very mature and soft in structure, this is a wine that needs to be drunk now. It has some richness, a dry edge and some attractive acidity, but it is not a wine that will improve."
France,Alsace,Hubert Meyer NV Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Crémant d'Alsace),Pinot Noir,85,14.0,Cherry and wild strawberry flavors dominate this fruity wine. It is very fresh with intense acidity and a crisp aftertaste. A few months more in bottle would help it soften.
France,Loire Valley,Henri Bourgeois 2014 Les Baronnes  (Sancerre),Pinot Noir,88,27.0,The wine is velvet soft with smooth red berries and gentle tannins. It has a line in acidity along with spice and a rounded texture. Drink this lightly wood-aged wine now.
France,Alsace,Domaine François Schmitt NV Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,89,30.0,A faint nose of tart red currant turns into a subtly flavored palate rich with cranberry notes and gentle herbal notes of hay flowers. This subtlety is also expressed in the fine mousse and the long dry but very full-fruited finish.
France,Burgundy,Pierre Cornu Camus 2011  Côte de Nuits-Villages,Pinot Noir,83,30.0,The wine seems soapy and out of focus. It's soft while missing fruit. The acidity and freshness at the end are the best parts.
France,Alsace,Joseph Cattin 2015 Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,89,19.0,"A coniferous lift weaves through tart red-cherry notes. The slender, translucent and crunchy palate is pervaded by the same aromas and a lot of freshness. This is a light-bodied aromatic red wine that is ideal for lunch, for picnics or for serving chilled."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Chevillon-Chezeaux 2014 Vieilles Vignes  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,90,45.0,"From a selection of old vines in four parcels, the wine has rich fruits, concentrated blackberry flavors and fully integrated tannins. It is ripe, juicy with fine acidity and a good potential. Drink this fine and fruity wine from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Bouchard Aîné & Fils 2011 Cuvée Signature Les Charmots Premier Cru  (Pommard),Pinot Noir,89,78.0,"This lean, firmly tannic wine is more about structure than fruit. There is a burnt, chocolate- and bitter-coffee flavor that gives edge to the palate, while firm tannins enrobe black-cherry fruit. Drink from 2016."
France,Champagne,Henriet-Bazin NV Blanc de Noirs Grand Cru Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,91,68.0,"From Verzenay on the Montagne de Reims this wine is rich, structured and concentrated. It has a rich texture plus spice as well as zesty orange and red-currant fruits. The wine retains some of the tannins of the red grapes although goes much more for a mineral texture. Drink now."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Chêne 2011  Bourgogne,Pinot Noir,83,,"The light color of this wine continues to the light palate, which just hints at strawberry fruits. Soft, finishing with fresh acidity, this lightweight wine should be drunk now."
France,Loire Valley,Vincent Roussely 2011 Clos Roussely Anthologie du Clos Red (Touraine),Red Blend,90,24.0,"A blend of Cabernet Franc, Gamay and Côt (aka Malbec), this smooth, dense and barrel-aged wine has impressive richness. Spice along with acidity and red berry fruits give a fresh aspect. The light tannins are dry and offer a balanced structure. It's ready to drink."
France,Burgundy,Pierre André 2009 Clos des Guettottes  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,90,42.0,"This walled vineyard has produced a surprisingly tannic, if impressive, wine for a Savigny in this vintage. It has a dark and firm character, the red berry fruits just beginning to break through the firm and dry tannins. It needs 4–5 years' aging."
France,Burgundy,Château de la Crée 2007 En Foulot  (Santenay),Pinot Noir,90,,A dry core pervades this full-bodied wine. Red fruits are masking its delicious ripe meat and sweet jam flavors. There is a distinct tannic element that holds this attractive wine together.
France,Burgundy,Labouré-Roi 2009 Les Hauts Tours  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,90,42.0,"A firmly tannic wine, the ripe fruit surrounded by a dry shell. It is already showing the firm chunky character of Nuits-St-Georges, with its dark plum and bitter cherry fruits well into the complex mix of flavors. Age for at least three years."
France,Burgundy,Evening Land 2011  Clos de Vougeot,Pinot Noir,91,100.0,"Still firm and closed, this is a structured wine, solidly tannic with just hints of fruit. It has a dry feel to it, firm, the acidity and red fruits coming through the leathery, dark texture. The wine needs aging, so drink from 2017."
France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Barton & Guestier 2009 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Vin de Pays d'Oc),Cabernet Sauvignon,84,8.0,"This wine is quite the bargain, offering nice fruit and spice for under $10. Simply structured with soft tannins, juicy black currant and plum flavors all accented by a hint of pepper. Drink now."
France,Southwest France,Château de Gayon 2010 Dou Hauret Red (Madiran),Red Blend,91,26.0,"Produced in the foothills of the Pyrenees mountains, this structured Tannat-based wine is dense and firm. Its tannins though are just the beginning, the entry point to the rich black fruits and concentrated texture. The wine, from a good vintage, is powerful, dense and needs to age. Drink from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Nuiton-Beaunoy 2010  Beaune,Pinot Noir,88,35.0,"A soft and rounded wine, full of ripe fruits that command all the attention. Red fruits dominate, just supported by tannins and a firm dryness. This is a rich wine that will age quickly, worth drinking in the next two years."
France,Burgundy,Nuiton-Beaunoy 2011  Pommard,Pinot Noir,88,50.0,"A chunky, solid wine, its tannins as important as its fruitiness. It shows black fruits, ripe bitter cherry flavors, along with dense tannins. Offering a powerful blast of Pinot Noir, and worth aging for three years."
France,Burgundy,Louis Bouillot NV Rosé Perle d'Aurore  (Crémant de Bourgogne),Pinot Noir,88,17.0,"Full, ripe wine, layered with fruits and a dry, more mineral core. The wine has good depth of flavor, strawberries, red currants and a citrus cut that keeps the wine fresh at the end."
France,Burgundy,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2016 Les Belles Roches  (Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Beaune),Pinot Noir,87,,"This is a lightly smoky wine from vineyards in the hills behind the Côte de Beaune. It is spicy with a touch of wood as well as red-cherry fruitiness. The wine needs to age a few months, so drink from late 2018."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Pierre Labet 2012 Vieilles Vignes  (Bourgogne),Pinot Noir,89,50.0,"With the concentration that comes from old vines, this is a rich wine intense with black-fruit flavors. It offers layers of wood and spice, with tannins and a dense texture that mean it is only just ready to drink. Rich and dark, it will be better from 2017."
France,Burgundy,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2014 Vieilles Vignes  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,89,50.0,"With the velvet texture typical of the appellation, this smooth wine offers a good balance between the red fruits and soft tannins. A smoky edge mingles with the berry-fruit acidity to give a wine ready to drink from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Henri de Villamont 2014 Clos des Guettes Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,89,,"This wine is ripe, full of red plums and soft tannins. It has a rich feel, soft and fruity. The tannins are velvety with juicy acidity and a generous feel. The wine will be ready to drink from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Manuel Olivier 2012  Clos de Vougeot,Pinot Noir,93,180.0,"Inevitably, coming from a Grand Cru vineyard, this wine is still very young. It has the beginnings of ripe black plum fruits that will develop well. For the moment, the tannins and structure show most strongly. Give this concentrated wine until 2019."
France,Southwest France,Domaine D'en Ségur 2015 Syrah-Duras Red (Côtes du Tarn),Red Blend,87,12.0,"This producer, based in the Tarn valley east of Cahors, has created a rounded, ripe and fruity wine. With some young tannins still in evidence, it is all about berry fruits and balanced acidity. The structure will soften over the next few months, so drink this attractively fruity wine from late 2017."
France,Southwest France,Domaine Rotier 2009 Les Gravels Red (Gaillac),Red Blend,90,,"Benefiting from the ripe 2009 vintage, this is an intense and concentrated wine, full of jammy plum and red berry flavors, spiced with licorice and pepper. The wine has good concentration. Ready to drink now or age 3–5 years."
France,Burgundy,Chanson Père et Fils 2008 Clos de Fèves  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,92,95.0,"Showing austerity via its tannins, this is a severe wine despite its red berry fruit. It has layers of wood and a dry core. Age for six years or more."
France,Alsace,Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2014 Vieilles Vignes Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,90,55.0,Beautifully pure cherry notes are subdued on the nose and fight against the privations of the 2014 vintage. There is lip-smacking freshness and admirable concentration on the textured palate with its velvety folds. The finish is clean and dry. Drink now through 2019.
France,Provence,Château de Calavon 2011 La Réserve Red (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence),Red Blend,91,40.0,"Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon make a warm, blend that is full, herbal and concentrated with black fruits and dark tannins. Spice provides a reminder that this wine comes from a warm climate. Drink now, although the wine will be better from 2016."
France,Burgundy,Château de Santenay 2013 Montée Rouge Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,92,80.0,"This firm wine is solid with tannins while also having the fruitiness of the year. A dry element will allow the wine to age balanced, with bright juicy fruits shining through. It comes from one of the lesser-known premier cru vineyards in Beaune. Drink from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2013  Chambolle-Musigny,Pinot Noir,88,102.0,"This is a very perfumed wine, full of red fruits and hedgerow berry flavors cut with some firm tannins. It has an aromatic character that is typical of Chambolle-Musigny, a soft, warm texture that is developing behind the tannins. It needs to age, so drink from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Louis Latour 2012  Nuits-St.-Georges,Pinot Noir,88,80.0,"There is some solid structure here, along with a tannic edge that marks out a wine for aging. This has plum skin and a dense texture that brings out a richness as well as the acidity that marks the vintage. It should be aged; drink from 2017."
France,Burgundy,Louis Max 2014 Domaine la Marche  (Mercurey),Pinot Noir,88,60.0,"This wine is rich with the sort of firm tannins that will give great supporting structure to the ripe berry fruits. With a juicy character, the wine is fresh and balanced with the solid tannins. It likely will be ready to drink from 2018."
France,Southwest France,Producteurs Plaimont 2013 Colombelle L'Originel Red (Côtes de Gascogne),Red Blend,85,8.0,"Stalky and light, this is a blend of Tannat, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. It has an herbaceous character that is balanced by berry fruits. It is the red berry fruitiness that dominates at the end."
France,Southwest France,Cave du Marmandais 2012 Ferran Pradets Red (Côtes du Marmandais),Red Blend,85,12.0,"This ripe, black-fruited wine is based mainly on Merlot and Abouriou. Full of juicy flavors with soft tannins, it's rich and ready to drink, and makes a great barbecue wine."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Des Meix Porons 2015 Vieilles Vignes  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,91,40.0,"Produced at a Domaine that is run by the Arnoux family, the wine has both a rich side and a firm side. The rich side is expressed in the bold red fruits, while the firm side comes through in the tannins and structure that will allow the wine to age. Drink this dense wine from 2020."
France,Burgundy,Domaine d'Ardhuy 2015  Savigny-lès-Beaune,Pinot Noir,91,,"The wine is structured, dense with tannins and smokiness from the wood aging. Its fruits, though in the background at this stage, offer fine black-cherry potential. Drink this concentrated wine from 2022."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Pierre Guillemot 2015 Vieilles Vignes  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,91,50.0,"A smoky spicy wine that is full of berry fruits and with some toasty wood-aging flavors. With its tannic structure it will need to age, although already the bright berry fruits are generous and ripe. Drink from 2022."
France,Burgundy,Henri de Villamont 2014 Les Chatelots Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny),Pinot Noir,92,,"Still firm and with dry tannins, this is a structured wine, with red fruits and acidity behind the concentrated texture. It suggests the succulent ripe fruitiness that will develop as the wine ages. Drink this generous wine from 2021."
France,Burgundy,Jaffelin 2014 Sur les Grèves Clos Sainte-Anne Premier Cru Monopole  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,92,58.0,"This is a smoky and ripe wine from Beaune's top premier cru. Structured, dusty tannins support the red fruits and acidity. The combination is already rich, but holds good potential as well. It will be best from 2020."
France,Burgundy,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2014 Les Rugiens Premier Cru  (Pommard),Pinot Noir,92,113.0,"This wine is rich, firmly structured while also full of dense black fruits. It comes from one of the top premier-cru vineyards in the appellation, well situated halfway up the slope, facing east. The wine will develop slowly as the ripe fruit comes through the structure. Drink from 2021."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Coquard Loisson-Fleurot 2014  Clos de Vougeot,Pinot Noir,92,120.0,"Every producer seems to own, or have access to, a small part of Clos de Vougeot even if quantities produced are tiny. This wine is still firm, packed with tannins although providing hints of the delicious red fruits to come. It is a structured while also generous wine, just needing time. Drink from 2022."
France,Burgundy,Domaine de Suremain 2014 Clos l'Evêque Premier Cru  (Mercurey),Pinot Noir,92,43.0,"This four-acre, east-facing slope has produced a rich, ripely maturing wine, with rounded red fruits layered with acidity. It's a generous wine, full in the mouth. The aftertaste continues the juicy, fruity theme, firmly sustained by the tannins."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Jessiaume 2014 Les Cent Vignes Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,92,47.0,"This rich wine has spice and red fruits backed by a dry texture. The smoky wood is still right up front, giving the wine a firm character. Wait for the fruit to develop further and drink from 2020."
France,Burgundy,Domaine d'Eugenie 2006  Clos de Vougeot,Pinot Noir,93,,"Bought in 2006 by François Pinault, also owner of Bordeaux Château Latour, Domaine d'Eugenie (the former Domaine René Engel) is just starting out. Already the style, as in this wine, exhibits power, concentration and structure. But here, also, there is great, vibrant fruit, the red berry flavors rolling around the mouth."
France,Burgundy,Maison Champy 2006  Echézeaux,Pinot Noir,93,150.0,"A big bruiser of a wine. It is easy to love the firm, complex structure allied with beautifully ripe, sweet fruit flavors. The wine is rich and powerful, but there are so many things going on here, from the intense tannins to the smoky black finish."
France,Burgundy,Roux Père et Fils 2005 Les Petits Vougeot Premier Cru  (Vougeot),Pinot Noir,93,,"An intensely perfumed wine, tight with tannins and red stone fruits. There is some hardness initially, then the wine opens out to give juicy, ripe red plums, dry tannins, spice and sweet acidity. The finish is full and dry. Age for several years."
France,Burgundy,Bouchard Père & Fils 2006 Les Suchots Premier Cru  (Vosne-Romanée),Pinot Noir,93,145.0,"The largest of the premier crus of Vosne-Romanée can make complete wines, as in this example. It has ripe fruit, touched with juiciness, but it is the enveloping firm and full structure that gives the wine its special character. It has a range of sweet fruit flavors, allied to dark tannins, suggesting aging potential."
France,Burgundy,Bouchard Père & Fils 2006 Rugiens Premier Cru  (Pommard),Pinot Noir,93,95.0,"Classic Pommard, a big, firm, tannic wine that is foursquare and dominating. It broods with its dense structure and concentration. The fruits are solid, with plum skins, red berries and bursts of acidity. All this adds up to a wine that needs to age. Aim for five years before drinking."
France,Burgundy,Chanson Père et Fils 2005 Clos des Mouches Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,93,90.0,"This wine is rich, sweet, extravagant and, finally, elegant. Its ripe fruit flavors, red plums, sweet strawberries and smoky acidity all work together. The wine shows considerable concentration, but never loses sight of freshness. Age for another five years at least."
France,Burgundy,Bouchard Père & Fils 2006 Clos des Chênes Premier Cru  (Volnay),Pinot Noir,93,70.0,"A structured, relatively cool Volnay, dominated more by ripe tannins than by fruit. The fruit that is there is fresh, layered with acidity, juicy in texture, with cranberry and black plum skin flavors. The finish suggests red berries with its firmness. The wine demands at least five years' aging."
France,Burgundy,Chanson Père et Fils 2005 Grèves Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,93,75.0,"A beautifully perfumed wine, all herbs and smokiness. The palate sings the same tune, a rich, sensuous one, laced with more somber notes of dark, dry tannins. At the end of the day, this is already a delicious wine, but one that will really improve over 5–10 years."
France,Burgundy,Bouchard Père & Fils 2006  Corton,Pinot Noir,93,115.0,"Corton is the largest grand cru in Burgundy (all of 240 acres) and its style can vary widely. Bouchard has gone for a relatively soft style, emphasizing fruits, raspberry, myrtle and black currants, topped with acidity. It is a light, delicious wine, but probably not for aging."
France,Burgundy,Maison Champy 2006  Mazis-Chambertin,Pinot Noir,93,125.0,"A dense, almost heavy wine, with smoky, licorice flavors that dominate the fruit. It is firm, big, solid, the sort of wine that demands attention with its concentration and powered structure. It may need time for aging, but already the power and weight are there."
France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot 2006 Domaine du Clos Frantin  (Echézeaux),Pinot Noir,93,,"Spicy, smoky Lapsang Souchong tea aromas, pure acidity and juicy red plum flavors are all here in this big, but finely structured wine. The tannins are an essential part of the shape of the wine, but act as a support for its richness. The finish brings out the lively acidity of Pinot Noir. Age for five years."
France,Burgundy,Bouchard Père & Fils 2006 Caillerets Premier Cru Ancienne Cuvée Carnot  (Volnay),Pinot Noir,93,85.0,"The richness of the fruit from Caillerets is so evident in this scrumptious wine. With its big, bold black fruits, it has sweetness, a soft, generous texture and evocative perfumes. It is so delicious and ready to drink now, that even the acidity that shows through has a hard time reminding us that this wine should age as well."
France,Alsace,Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2014 Réserve Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,89,30.0,"The nose is very quiet but the body emanates a generosity despite its lightness. There is red-cherry fruit and a certain ampleness on a slender, fresh body. Tannins are like barely-there linens. The finish is wonderfully clean."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Faiveley 2014 Clos des Myglands  (Mercurey),Pinot Noir,89,48.0,"Fresh and packed with red fruits, this wine comes from the Faiveley domaine. With raspberry flavors and plenty of acidity, the wine is forward and going to develop quickly. Drink from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2014  Pommard,Pinot Noir,89,68.0,"Even in a fruity year, Pommard lives up to its reputation for firm tannins. This wine will have delicious ripe black fruits, although not just yet. The structure and the dark tannins are up front, leaving tantalizing hints of the richness to come. Drink from 2019."
France,Burgundy,Domaine A. Machard de Gramont 2014 Les Damodes Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,89,80.0,"From vines in the north of the Nuits Saint-Georges, close to Vosne-Romanée, this is a structured wine. It has ripe berry fruits and acidity that are still developing through the firm, dry tannins. The wine is still young and needs to age, so drink from 2019."
France,Burgundy,Domaine de Suremain 2014  Mercurey,Pinot Noir,89,34.0,"This wine is smoky yet fresh and juicy. It has a light touch of red-currant fruits, a crisp texture and bright acidity. The tannins are gentle, leaving pride of place to the natural fruitiness of the wine. Drink from 2017."
France,Southwest France,Château de Gayon 2009 Dou Hauret Red (Madiran),Red Blend,91,50.0,"In this ripe, smooth wine, the fruit dominates the tannic structure. Black fruits, dense plums and blackberry flavors are rich and concentrated. The firmer underlay is dark, brooding and promises good aging. This is not a shy wine and it will also need aging, so drink from 2018."
France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Domaines Astruc 2007 dA Reserve Pinot Noir (Vin de Pays d'Oc),Pinot Noir,84,10.0,Six months in oak barrels have given the nose of this wine a lovely overlay of mocha and coffee on top of the cherry fruit. Raspberry flavors dominate the mouth while vanilla and strawberry linger on the finish. Lush acidity and only the barest remnant of tannin make this a good choice forwhite fish in a fruit-based sauce.
France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Little Black Dress 2006 Pinot Noir (Vin de Pays d'Oc),Pinot Noir,84,10.0,"A top choice in a generally weak category, this Pinot shows pretty strawberry and raspberry scents that yield to earth and cherry flavors in the mouth. The palate is well balanced and followed by a strawberry-infused finish. Although this wine shows quite a bit of promise, some slightly gummy notes on the nose and palate preclude a higher score at this time."
France,Southwest France,Cave du Marmandais 2012 Château Bazin Red (Côtes du Marmandais),Red Blend,88,45.0,"This rich, full-bodied wine is packed with ripe, dense blackberry and plum flavors. With firm tannins in the background, it is always going to be dark and solid. Produced on a single vineyard by the local cooperative, it could still age and will be best from 2016."
France,Burgundy,Labouré-Roi 2015 Les Marconnets Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,91,50.0,"Although this wine is tight with tannins and wood aging, it shows the softer side of the appellation with its ripe red berry fruit. Needing more time in bottle to deliver the opulence of its fine Premier Cru vineyard, it will be best from 2022."
France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Villa Noria 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Pays d'Oc),Cabernet Sauvignon,85,,"The deep red-black color reaches from core to rim. The fragrant nose centers around hot chocolate and candied cherries. Dry on the attack with adequate acidity, the wine shows moderate extraction and medium alcohol that lead to a short finish."
France,France Other,Henri Milan 2010 Sans Soufre Ajouté Red (Vin de France),Red Blend,85,35.0,"A wine with only natural sulfur, it feels lean, with piercing acidity and firm tannins. It is young and all the elements should fall into place, but with the fruit's stalky character the wine will always be dry."
France,Burgundy,Domaine de la Ferté 2008 Servoisine Premier Cru  (Givry),Pinot Noir,90,34.0,"With some richness, red fruits over wood and a full-bodied structure, this is a solid, dense wine. Acidity is present, while the ripe juicy fruits more than balance it. The tannins offer a firm structure and suggest aging."
France,Burgundy,Henri de Villamont 2007 Les Feusselottes Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny),Pinot Noir,90,,"This is a delicate wine, sweet strawberry and elegant structure combining over a soft texture. There is a hint of smokiness as an addition to the finely rounded aftertaste."
France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot 2015 Domaine du Pavillon Clos des Ursulines  (Pommard),Pinot Noir,94,79.0,"The wallled Clos des Ursulines is wholly owned by this producer. This perfumed wine is showing strong wood aromas as well as concentrated spice. Underneath, the generous juicy fruit has a fine balance between red plums and bright acidity. Drink from 2022."
France,Burgundy,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2015  Corton Vergennes,Pinot Noir,94,,"From one of the parcels that make up the larger Corton Grand Cru, this is a powerful wine with a proper sense of its dignity. It is stylish as well as rich—an elegant blending of ripe red fruits, tannins and acidity. The wine of course has great potential and will not be ready to drink until 2025."
France,Burgundy,Henri de Villamont 2015 Renardes  (Corton Les Renardes),Pinot Noir,94,,"This is a powerful wine with concentration and dark tannins. It is rich, packed with black fruits and acidity. The wine has spice, a bold structure and a great future. The wine, from one of the vineyards within the Corton Grand Cru, is likely to be ready to drink from 2025."
France,Burgundy,Alex Gambal 2011 Cuvée des Deux Papis  (Bourgogne),Pinot Noir,88,30.0,"Rich red fruits combine with good acidity, raspberry flavors and soft tannins. Ripe and juicy, it shows great fruitiness at the end."
France,Burgundy,Arnoux & Fils 2011 Les Pimentiers  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,88,,"Ripe and jammy, it's full of red fruit jelly flavors. It has just enough tannic structure to support the fruit, giving balance with a dry core and fragrant acidity. It's rich, full in the mouth and needs time. Drink from 2017."
France,Burgundy,Bouchard Père & Fils 2011  Monthélie,Pinot Noir,88,45.0,"This is a ripe and fruity wine, with soft tannins and rich raspberry fruits. Already accessible, it's very full in the mouth, wonderfully juicy and jammy, yet with some freshness at the end."
France,Burgundy,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2011 Les Vaucrains Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,88,148.0,"A fragrant wine, it offers truffle and red fruit aromas. The palate is ripe although it does have intense acidity, more bright red fruits than firmer structure. It feels almost ready to drink, fruity and fresh."
France,France Other,Château d'Aydie 2013 Aramis Red (Vin de France),Red Blend,85,10.0,"A fruity blend of Tannat, Syrah and Cabernet Franc that has berry fruits, a stalky texture and touches of wood spice. It's an easy, juicy wine, made fresh and ripe to be drunk now."
France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Château du Donjon 2003 Cuvée Prestige Red (Minervois),Red Blend,87,17.0,"This blend of 60% Syrah, 40% Grenache starts off with scents of charred beef and smoke, then adds coffee and blackberry flavors to give it plenty of complexity. The tannins are soft, lingering on the finish with traces of caramel and vanilla. Drink it now and over the next few years."
France,Loire Valley,Hubert Veneau 2010 Red (Coteaux du Giennois),Red Blend,87,,"A delicious bone dry rosé, so fresh and lively with its vivid acidity lightening up the red fruits and offering great accompaniment to so many dishes."
France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Château de Lancyre 2003 Pic Saint-Loup Vieilles Vignes Red (Coteaux du Languedoc),Red Blend,86,20.0,"Starts with clean cedary aromas and bold cassis scents, then slowly works in flavors of coffee, licorice and earth. It's medium- to full-bodied, with a dusty, tannic finish. Hold a couple of years, then try with stews or braises."
France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot 2006 Domaine Adélie Les Champs Martin Premier Cru  (Mercurey),Pinot Noir,86,,"Soft, jammy, forward wine, that exhibits sweet strawberries, a generous structure, and only light tannins. Drink now."
France,Loire Valley,Fournier Père et Fils 2010 No 22  (Sancerre),Pinot Noir,90,85.0,"A very rich and smooth Pinot Noir that is impressively concentrated. It has rich, structured fruit and fragrant acidity, red plums and a sense of tannin. This could certainly age, so drink after 2015."
France,Burgundy,Alex Gambal 2013 Les Picotins  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,89,40.0,"With a good sense of structure, this bottling, formerly called Vieilles Vignes, comes from 55-year-old vines. It is textured, with some firm tannins as well as ripe plum flavors and acidity. The wine is still developing and will be better from 2016."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Jessiaume 2010 Brouillards Premier Cru  (Volnay),Pinot Noir,91,66.0,"Rich and full, this wine shows some sense of structure. It has considerable acidity and flavors of cherry and red currant. With the dry tannins coming through on the finish, it will need some years to soften."
France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot 2010 Domaine du Pavillon Rugiens Premier Cru  (Pommard),Pinot Noir,91,,"Rugiens,  which is named after its red soil, is located in the south of Pommard. Dense, structured and powerful, this is a brooding wine that has concentrated tannins and fruit that is offset by a tight line of acidity. This is a wine that demands aging."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Faiveley 2009 Clos des Myglands Premier Cru  (Mercurey),Pinot Noir,89,40.0,"Expect ripe and open fruit from this Faiveley owned vineyard in Mercurey. The wine tastes soft, the tannins well integrated into the ripe cherry and berry fruits. It could age, but it is ready to drink now."
France,France Other,Clos Teddi 2006 Rouge Red (Patrimonio),Red Blend,86,25.0,"A blend of the local Niellucciu and Sciaccarello grapes, this is a robust wine, with rustic tannins, blackberry acidity and a firm dry core. A great barbecue wine, finishing very fresh with a layer of wood."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Jacques Prieur 2009 Santenots  (Volnay),Pinot Noir,88,128.0,"Produced from young vines, this fresh, fruity wine offers immediate pleasure, with red berries and sweet fruit flavors over a spicy layer of wood and a soft, generous texture."
France,Burgundy,Roux Père et Fils 2009 Bearegard  (Santenay),Pinot Noir,88,46.0,"Like a freshly picked cherry, all juicy fruit with sweet perfumes and a jammy, ripe character. The wine is soft, open and already accessible."
France,Burgundy,Château de Santenay 2013 Les Brunettes et Planchots  (Aloxe-Corton),Pinot Noir,90,80.0,"Produced from two parcels in Aloxe Corton, this structured wine has red-plum fruitiness that is still masked by a dry tannic coating. It has concentration and good potential. Drink this textured, firm wine from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Philippe Jeannot 2015 Quentin Jeannot La Fussière Premier Cru  (Maranges),Pinot Noir,88,30.0,This is a pale-colored wine with a soft texture and gentle strawberry fruits. The texture comes through slowly to give a firmer edge to what is a wine for medium-term aging. This is stylish and smooth. It should be drunk from 2018.
France,Burgundy,Nicolas Potel 2014 Les Marconnets Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,90,60.0,"This wine comes from one of the best vineyard sites in Savigny-lès-Beaune, on the slope closest to Beaune. It is a smooth, perfumed and ripe wine that has a balanced structure under the bright red-cherry flavor. Still bursting with young fruit, the wine will age, so wait to drink until 2019."
France,Burgundy,Chanson Père et Fils 2013 Dominode Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,90,68.0,"Damaged by hail in 2013, the vineyards yielded low quantities. The grapes harvested produced a wine with crisp red fruits and bright berry acidity. The fresh, tight aftertaste suggests the wine will age. Drink from 2019."
France,Southwest France,Domaine D'en Ségur 2008 Red (Côtes du Tarn),Red Blend,86,13.0,"A blend of Merlot and Duras, the red grape of Gaillac. The combination creates a meaty and chewy wine, with pepper and red-currant flavors. While the Merlot supplies the warmth, the Duras offers acidity and fruitiness. Drink now."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Jessiaume 2007 Bourgogne Pinot Noir  (Burgundy),Pinot Noir,84,,"Certainly light, but also deliciously fruity, with raspberries a dominant flavor in the juicy acidity and the softest, velvet tannins. Drink now."
France,Burgundy,Manuel Olivier 2009  Hautes Côtes de Nuits,Pinot Noir,85,17.0,"Warm, ripe and round, this red-fruited wine has a fine feeling of richness. It is soft and fruity, with just the right amount of acidity to balance. Ready to drink."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Guy & Yvan Dufouleur 2009 Clos du Chapitre Premier Cru  (Fixin),Pinot Noir,85,68.0,"While the texture is rich and full-bodied, there is an edge of sharp acidity that takes away from the generous ripeness. Tannins and juicy red fruits are present, but the acidity is a little jarring."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Faiveley 2009 Les Rugiens Premier Cru  (Pommard),Pinot Noir,91,115.0,"Sweet new wood goes with rich plum skins in a wine that has a firm structure. The richness of the wine revolves around sweet cherries and juicy acidity. With the wood still dominant, it needs at least five years to settle down."
France,Burgundy,Joseph Drouhin 2009  Pommard,Pinot Noir,91,50.0,"A solid wine, with plum skin and dry tannin textures. It does have the ripe fruit of 2009, attractive red fruits and juicy acidity. But it needs aging over at least three years to show its fruitiness."
France,Burgundy,Vignerons de Buxy 2008 Buissonnier  (Bourgogne),Pinot Noir,83,15.0,"A lightweight wine, almost tangy in its freshness. Wild strawberry flavors give a great liveliness to a wine that is taut in its acidity."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Champy 2010  Volnay,Pinot Noir,87,,"Ripe and round, this has a strawberry flavor that is surrounded by dense tannins. It shows a fine line of fresh acidity, and it is ready to drink, although it will age for several years."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Champy 2010  Chorey-lès-Beaune,Pinot Noir,86,,"This underrated village, which is located next to Savigny-lès-Beaune, has produced an attractive, fruity wine that has a fine structure, a red berry flavor and a twist of acidity on the finish. Keep this for 2–3 years."
France,Alsace,Domaine Michel Fonne 2013 Tradition Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,86,17.0,"Pure red fruit seems to have a bruised apple edge. The palate is simple and easy-drinking and despite its pretty ruby color comes across as a rosé, with barely a touch of tannin. Chill this for a surprise at a party."
France,Alsace,Domaine Sipp-Mack 2013 Tradition Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,86,27.0,"Simple, but up-front strawberry fruit reigns on nose and palate of this very light-bodied red. The palate is soft, easy, dry and fresh and would take very well to chilling on a warm day."
France,Loire Valley,Domaine Vacheron 2008  Sancerre,Pinot Noir,90,,"Vacheron are masters of red Sancerre, and this wine lives up to the billing. There are impressively ripe fruits, flavors of the brightest berries and a sweet, pure character, emphasized by the acidity and underlined by wood."
France,Burgundy,Louis Jadot 2013 Les Estournelles Saint-Jacques Premier Cru  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,94,133.0,"This wine is dark and dense, very closed at this young stage. But wait for that rich fruit to burst out to give its intense acidity and ripeness to the wine. It's a powerhouse of flavors, spice and dark minerality. Drink from 2022."
France,Burgundy,Louis Jadot 2013 Theurons Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,94,62.0,"This wine is dark, with a strong sense of structure. Dense black fruits are cut with strawberry acidity and a dark tension between fruit and firm tannins. The coiled power will allow this beautiful wine age for many years. Drink from 2020."
France,Burgundy,Henri de Villamont 2012  Corton Les Renardes,Pinot Noir,93,,"More structure and less fruit is the characteristic of this wine. A dry core is very present, giving a tough edge at this stage. There are the hints of red fruits and powerful acidity that will develop. With its weight, this is a wine for the long term. Drink from 2019."
France,Burgundy,Joseph Drouhin 2012 Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny),Pinot Noir,93,113.0,"Ripe and full of raspberries, this has a structure well cushioned by the ripe texture. The wine is packed with acidity while having a sense of floral, aromatic fruitiness. From four different parcels in premier cru, this seductive wine will also age well. Drink from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Alex Gambal 2013 Grèves Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,93,57.0,"From one of the top Premier Cru vineyards in Beaune, this structured wine shows concentration and richness. Packed with tannins in its center, it is cushioned by the generous red berry and cherry fruits. The wine has a finely perfumed aftertaste. Drink from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Alex Gambal 2013  Vosne-Romanée,Pinot Noir,93,85.0,"From vines close to the Sachets Premier Cru vineyard, this wine is powerful, structured and dense, despite the relatively low alcohol that gives it a lift of red fruits, acidity and perfume. It is still developing, a wine in progress, as its backbone of tannins softens. Drink from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Albert Morot 2012 La Bataillère aux Vergelesses Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,87,61.0,"For the wine and its fruit, there is too much firm extract here. It brings out very dry tannins and licorice flavors that cover the fruit. It's going to be a difficult wine to soften."
France,Alsace,Emile Beyer 2009 Cuvée de l'Hostellerie Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,85,,"Bitter cherries and dark, tarry flavors mark this wood-aged Pinot Noir. There is a strong new wood character that gives some bitterness. The wine needs another year to soften."
France,Alsace,Robert Klingenfus 2010 Signature Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,85,15.0,"Bitter cherry flavors mark a wine that is light in texture, with attractive acidity and a soft, fruity red berry finish. Not for aging."
France,Southwest France,Alain Brumont 2007 Château Bouscassé Argile Red (Madiran),Red Blend,93,,"A parcel of fine red clay in the Bouscassé vineyard is the inspiration behind this wine. That gives both richness and a strongly mineral character that brings out a distinct texture and considerable acidity. The wine is dark, brooding, still with plenty of fresh fruits. Almost ready to drink, it will always have powerful tannins and acidity. Decanting this wine is essential."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Luc et Lise Pavelot 2011  Pernand-Vergelesses,Pinot Noir,88,30.0,"This is a firm style of wine, showing the mineral character of Pernand-Verglesses reds. The wine has a nervy, almost herbal profile, showing red currants and considerable acidity."
France,Burgundy,Manuel Olivier NV Brut Rosé  (Crémant de Bourgogne),Pinot Noir,88,20.0,"Made 100% from Pinot Noir, this delicious rosé has fine red fruits, a great clean streak of acidity and a light touch of tannin to give structure. Very pure, very fresh."
France,Burgundy,Pierre André 2009  Aloxe-Corton,Pinot Noir,88,,"From the home village of Pierre André's Château Corton-André, this is a solid, chunky wine, its tannins very prevalent at this stage. It promises to be a smoother, wood-aged sip with blackberry and spice as well as a tasty juiciness."
France,Alsace,Charles Sparr NV Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Crémant d'Alsace),Pinot Noir,85,23.0,"Pure Pinot Noir has produced a full, fruity sparkling wine. It is lightly crisp, fresh with wild strawberries and acidity. The aftertaste, soft and rounded, has a satisfying creamy character."
France,Burgundy,Vignerons de Buxy 2011 Clos Jus Premier Cru  (Givry),Pinot Noir,85,,"This is a fresh Pinot Noir with plenty of crisp red fruits and soft tannins. It's all about fruitiness, with a character that demands to be drunk now."
France,Burgundy,Derey Frères 2012 Les Vignes Marie  (Marsannay),Pinot Noir,85,35.0,"This perfumed wine offers plenty (perhaps too much) acidity and red fruits, with only light tannins. That makes for a fruity wine, fresh and ready to drink now and until 2018."
France,Burgundy,Manuel Olivier 2011 Vieilles Vignes  (Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Nuits),Pinot Noir,85,30.0,"The light color of 2011 is evident in this bottling. It follows through to a soft, rounded, fruity wine that is lightly textured. Acidity and juicy red fruits offer a wine that is drinkable now."
France,Burgundy,Manuel Olivier 2012  Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Nuits,Pinot Noir,85,24.0,"Fruit and tannins harmonize in this ripe, soft wine. Attractive red berry fruits and lively acidity partner with a smooth texture. It's not a wine for aging, and will be ready to drink from 2015."
France,Burgundy,Alex Gambal 2013  Vougeot,Pinot Noir,92,85.0,"There are not many village wines made in Vougeot with the large areas devoted to Premier and Grand Cru. This wine has reminiscences of the structure of those top wines although it is delicious in its fragrant strawberries, full and with just the right amount of acidity. The fruit comes from the Clos du Château. Drink from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Henri de Villamont 2012  Grands-Echezeaux,Pinot Noir,92,,"Very dense, this wine has some bitter extract and layers of wood that give it a very firm structure. While there is acidity, the wine also has a dark character that is hard and powerful. It is likely always to be a solid wine. Drink from 2020."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Faiveley 2014 Clos du Roy Premier Cru  (Mercurey),Pinot Noir,90,56.0,"With some firm structure behind the red fruits, this wine will have a good future. A dry core sustained by the acidity is waiting to burst out and give a ripe, fruity while always fresh wine. Drink from 2018."
France,Alsace,Domaine Fernand Engel 2013 Cuvée Fernand Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,90,30.0,"The nose is reminiscent of dried pine cones and miso. It is only on the palate that some fruit appears: Hints of red cherry mix with the same pine notes and are fringed with pleasant bitterness. The palate is light in weight but concentrated. This calls out for food—think game and mushroom dishes. The finish is juicy, refreshing and moreish."
France,Burgundy,Roche de Bellene 2011 Aux Boudots Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,93,112.0,"A dense, sumptuously structured wine that is full both of tannins and juicy fruit. Black plum, layers of acidity and the lightest hint of wood aging all play a part in this already drinkable wine. It will be better in five years, so wait until 2017."
France,Loire Valley,François Millet 2013 Empreinte Rouge  (Sancerre),Pinot Noir,86,29.0,"This soft and smooth wine has just the right amount of smoky tannins to support the ripe, bitter cherry fruits and fresh acidity. It is still all fruit and certainly would benefit from aging, so drink from 2017."
France,Burgundy,Domaine René Bouvier 2011 Les Fontenys Premier Cru  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,93,128.0,"This firm wine has structure as well as enticing sweet red berry fruits. Dynamic and fruity, it has a dark structure that impressively expresses this solid terroir. Drink from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Alex Gambal 2011 Vieilles Vignes  (Vosne-Romanée),Pinot Noir,93,75.0,"From vines more than 50 years old, this is a full-throated, concentrated wine. Solid tannins and rich black fruits combine with structure and a sweet, ripe aftertaste. The acidity at the end gives just the right lift. Drink this powerful wine from 2017."
France,Burgundy,Bouchard Père & Fils 2011 Les Cailles Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,93,100.0,"A wine with great sweet fruits along with smoky, firm tannins. It is certainly structured, and the black jelly fruits are already delicious. Weight partners with acidity, creating a combination of freshness and richness at the end. Drink from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Chanson 2011 Clos des Mouches Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,93,105.0,"Firm and structured, this dense and dark wine offers ripe black fruits and a concentrated texture.

France,Loire Valley,Domaine Sautereau 2014 Côte de Reigny  (Sancerre),Pinot Noir,88,22.0,"This perfumed wine has light, ripe fruits and soft tannins. Red cherry and raspberry flavors dominate the palate of a wine that is still young. Drink this attractive wine from 2017."
France,Southwest France,Domaine D'en Ségur 2009 Le Rouge Red (Côtes du Tarn),Red Blend,84,15.0,"This complex blend of Duras, Syrah and Braucol has a definite rustic, earthy character. It is tannic and stalky, showing some greenness. With its berry fruits right to the fore it is not for aging."
France,Burgundy,Alex Gambal 2014  Charmes-Chambertin,Pinot Noir,95,,"Seriously structured and full of robust tannins, this wine has enough rich fruit to match. As it opens, red plum and black cherry flavors shine. Dense, powerful and intense, it's a fine contender for long-term aging. Drink from 2025."
France,Burgundy,Roche de Bellene 2012 Vieilles Vignes  (Volnay),Pinot Noir,92,64.0,"Generous and rounded, this wine combines the opulence of Volnay with a strongly tannic character coming from the old vines. Together, it's a rich, fruit-filled wine that is backed by a dry core and fragrant red berry acidity. Drink from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Henri de Villamont 2007 Les Chatelots Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny),Pinot Noir,92,,"A delicious wine with all the roundness and style of a Chambolle. The texture is soft, but given a firm cushion of tannins and vanilla from the wood aging. Given 2–3 years, this will be a lovely wine."
France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot 2007 Domaine du Clos Frantin Aux Malconsorts Premier Cru  (Vosne-Romanée),Pinot Noir,92,,"A wine that shows a more delicate side of the vineyard, as the texture is rounded and juicy. The structure is fully in place, hinting at licorice and black chocolate while pushing the red berry fruits forward. The final tannins are soft and open."
France,Burgundy,Bouchard Père & Fils 2008 Ancienne Cuvée Carnot Caillerets Premier Cru  (Volnay),Pinot Noir,92,85.0,"Structured and concentrated, it has a silky richness that is very Volnay, while at the same time giving the bright fruits of the year. The final tastes are smoke and crisp acidity."
France,Burgundy,Henri de Villamont 2014 Feusselottes Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny),Pinot Noir,92,81.0,"The tannins are linear and direct in this otherwise fruity wine. Along with dark tannins, it is also rich with warm red fruits. The acidity still shows strongly and suggests that the wine needs time. Drink from 2020."
France,Burgundy,Bouchard Père & Fils 2014 Les Lavières Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,92,60.0,"Grown on rocky subsoil, this ripe and fruity wine has good acidity and plenty of black-cherry fruit.

France,Burgundy,Domaine d'Ardhuy 2014 Aux Clous Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,92,,"This wine is well balanced, with red-berry and plum-fruit flavors giving richness. A ripe, juicy character comes with the tight acidity. The smoky wood is just right. Drink from 2019."
France,Burgundy,Louis Latour 2012  Vosne-Romanée,Pinot Noir,90,90.0,"This is well balanced, ripe and with a good link between the structure and the fragrant, perfumed red berries. The wine is full of fruit and acidity while having a core of dark tannins that will allow it to age. It will be best drunk after 2018."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Clos Salomon 2013 Clos Salomon Premier Cru  (Givry),Pinot Noir,90,45.0,"This rich, creamy, juicy wine is full of strawberry fruits and ripe tannins. It has weight and density as well as powerful structure. A fresh black-cherry character comes through, giving acidity and a perfumed aftertaste. Drink from 2017."
France,Burgundy,Louis Latour 2005 Les Chaillots Premier Cru  (Aloxe-Corton),Pinot Noir,88,60.0,"Definitely on the dry side, showing the tannic face of Pinot Noir. This is a serious wine that reflects its status as a premier cru, a powerful mix of cranberry fruits and dark tannins, but marked by a hot, hard aftertaste."
France,Burgundy,Domaines Devillard 2010 Domaine des Perdrix Aux Perdrix Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,91,98.0,"With its intense red fruits and acidity, this initially seems so fruity. Slowly the powerful structure comes into play, yielding a concentrated, cellar-worthy wine."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Heresztyn 2010 Les Champonnets Premier Cru  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,91,94.0,"While this is currently firm and closed, it promises fine things to come. Weight and richness combine with a solid core of tannins. The intense, refreshing acidity is a counterpoint to the ripe black-plum flavor. With all of this concentration, this should age for over 5–6 years."
France,Burgundy,Jean-Claude Boisset 2009 Les Chardannes  (Chambolle-Musigny),Pinot Noir,91,72.0,"The tannins are already finely integrated into the rich, ripe fruit. It has a smoky character along with a note of wood spice, and the black plum fruit serves as a juicy underlay. Given its weight and structure, this should for age five years at least."
France,Burgundy,Vincent Prunier 2010 Les Chaponnières Premier Cru  (Pommard),Pinot Noir,91,,"This is a big, wood-laden smoky wine, with notes of spice and enticing toast to go with the firm tannins. At the same time, the fruit is vying to show its rich red-plum character. Give this 4–5 years to begin to show its best."
France,Burgundy,Vincent Sauvestre 2010 Les Maréchaudes Premier Cru  (Aloxe-Corton),Pinot Noir,91,,"Complex and structured, this has rich tannins and a strawberry jam flavor from the ripe fruit.

France,Burgundy,Domaine Méo-Camuzet 2013 Les Argillières Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,92,,"Smoky and aromatic, this wine shows great fruitiness against dark, structured tannins.

France,Burgundy,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2012  Corton Vergennes,Pinot Noir,92,153.0,"This is a concentrated, dark and brooding wine. Its complexity comes from the interplay of tannins and rich red fruits, laced with tight acidity. Serious and dense, it is a wine for long aging. Drink this impressive wine from 2019."
France,Burgundy,Alex Gambal 2013 Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,92,45.0,"Because of such small harvests in 2013 because of hail, Alex Gambal decided to make one wine from all his premier cru parcels in Savigny-lès-Beaune. This wine is rich and ripe, full of sweet crushed strawberry flavors as well as a dry core of structure. Age this fine wine and drink from 2017."
France,Burgundy,Antonin Rodet 2010 Clos de Thorey Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,93,75.0,"A solid and structured wine from this premier cru vineyard which is a Rodet monopoly.

Generous and ripe with red berry fruits and gentle tannins, it could age until late 2015 before drinking."
France,Southwest France,Château de Rhodes 2012 Red (Gaillac),Red Blend,92,17.0,"Made from organic grapes, this wine blends every variety grown in Gaillac. Everything gels together to give a concentrated wine that is both solid and powerful with a dry core. Rich berry fruits are complemented by a stream of acidity. It's a wine to age; drink from 2017."
France,Burgundy,Château de Santenay 2014 Vieilles Vignes  (Bourgogne),Pinot Noir,86,25.0,"Sourced from grapes grown in the Côte Chalonnaise, this is a soft, red-fruit-flavored wine, with a ripe, jammy character that makes it almost sweet. It is ready to drink."
France,Burgundy,Patriarche Père et Fils 2014 Les Chaboeufs Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,86,64.0,"Strong wood flavors dominate this wine. While there are hints of the juicy red fruits, the burnt toast is too strong. While that will soften, it seems likely that woodiness will be with the wine a long time."
France,Burgundy,Château de Santenay 2014 Clos Philippe le Hardi  (Hautes Cotes de Beaune),Pinot Noir,89,30.0,"Philip the Bold was Duke of Burgundy in the 14th century and owner of this estate. This wine that comes from vines next to Saint-Aubin is cool and fresh, emphasizing red currants and acidity. It needs to broaden out, which will happen in the next two to three years. Drink from 2019."
France,Burgundy,Albert Morot 2015 Les Cent Vignes Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,95,45.0,"Ripe, warm and with delicious strawberry and red-plum fruits, the wine is generous and full of fruit.

France,Loire Valley,Château de Tigné 2011 L'Isensé Cabernet Sauvignon (Anjou),Cabernet Sauvignon,85,49.0,There is considerable power in this rich wine.

France,Burgundy,Maison Champy 2008 Les Grands Epenots Premier Cru  (Pommard),Pinot Noir,90,,"A perfumed wine, only just hinting at Pommard chunkiness and tannic structure. This is more polished and smooth, with a strong toasty wood element, while still delivering a fine, jammy, sweet aftertaste."

It is richly concentrated, a good example of the richer, more serious style of Pinot Noir that is coming from Sancerre. It is structured and can age, so drink from 2017."
France,Burgundy,Louis Jadot 2013 Clos des Couchereaux Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,94,62.0,"From one of the rare south-facing vineyards in Beaune, this warm, rich and ripe wine is generous with its spice, smokiness and rounded red fruits.

Produced from a blend that puts Bordeaux grapes with a small proportion of the local Abouriou, it will be ready in 2020."
France,Southwest France,Domaine Rotier 2015 Les Gravels Red (Gaillac),Red Blend,91,,"Blending the three red grapes of Gaillac (Duras, Braucol and Syrah), this is an impressively rich wine, with signs of its wood aging just integrating with the ripe black-currant fruit and firm tannins.

France,Southwest France,Domaine Laurens 2013 Cuvée de Flars  (Marcillac),Red Blend,89,20.0,"This wine is a vineyard selection, aged in wood for 12 months.

Drink from 2018."
France,Southwest France,Domaine du Moulié 2011 Red (Madiran),Red Blend,90,13.0,"A fine blend with 60% Tannat that has been softened and filled out by Cabernets Franc and Sauvignon. It still does have a firm tannic core although this is surrounded by ripe black fruits and acidity. It has all its bright fruit and so could age further, although it is now ready to drink."
France,Provence,Jules 2004 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Côtes de Provence),Cabernet Sauvignon,88,25.0,"Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, this shows off Cabernet's cedary, leafy qualities to advantage, using them to accent its cassis fruit. It's a nicely balanced, medium-bodied Cab, with a smooth texture and chocolate and cedar accents on the finish. Ready to drink now, but it should hold for at least another few years."
France,Southwest France,Château Bouissel 2008 Le Bouissel Red (Fronton),Red Blend,90,20.0,"An impressively structured wine, this great blend of Négrette, Syrah and Malbec shows intense tannins underlying powerful juicy black fruit flavors. Aromatic, spicy and driven by its dry texture, it should age for several years."
France,Alsace,Cave de Ribeauvillé 2013 Lieu-dit Kugelberg Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,93,28.0,"A touch of flinty reduction clings to the nose but soon relaxes into soft notes of ripe black cherry. The palate is textured and dry, harmonious with fruit and the gentle ripple and crunch of slightly rustic but utterly pleasant tannins. This seems to be its perfect drinking window now: generous with fruit, utterly harmonious and starting to mellow. The finish is fresh, clean and totally moreish. If you can resist at all, this may well continue to develop. Drink now through 2025."
France,Southwest France,Château Bouissel 2012 Classic Red (Fronton),Red Blend,88,16.0,"With a dominance of juicy Negrette in the blend, this is a soft, fruity wine.

France,Loire Valley,Vignobles Berthier 2012 Domaine de Montbenoit Pinot Noir (Coteaux du Giennois),Pinot Noir,87,16.0,"This structured wine is young, with a firm character that is still masking the juicy red fruits.

France,Loire Valley,Vignobles Berthier 2013 Domaine des Clairneaux  (Sancerre),Pinot Noir,87,28.0,"So light in color, this Pinot Noir is almost a rosé. The texture and structure, though, are definitely of a red wine. Firm tannins give a backbone to the red cherry fruitiness and fresh acidity. It's still young so keep this wine until 2016."

France,Burgundy,Manuel Olivier 2011  Aloxe-Corton,Pinot Noir,88,50.0,"This is a delicious, fruity wine with just a core of tannins to hold it together. It is packed with red berry fruits along with intense, still-youthful acidity. As it develops, it will become fruitier and softer."
France,Loire Valley,Patient Cottat 2010 Anciennes Vignes  (Sancerre),Pinot Noir,87,26.0,"With its light color, this is a soft and fruity wine that is now beginning to mature.

France,Southwest France,Chateau Saint Louis 2012 Red (Fronton),Red Blend,84,17.0,"Dominated by Fronton's own native Négrette grape, this is a spicy, earthy wine. A green bell pepper undertow gives freshness while also an unripe character. The wine should be drunk now."
France,Burgundy,Jean-Claude Boisset 2011 Dames Huguettes  (Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Nuits),Pinot Noir,84,,"A perfumed, light, fruity wine that comes from the hill vineyards behind the Côte de Nuits. It has red fruits, light tannins and a juicy, fresh aftertaste. Drink now."
France,Burgundy,L. Tramier & Fils 2010  Gevrey-Chambertin,Pinot Noir,84,,This very earthy wine with a barnyard character has lost its fruit. It does have structure but it is not likely to lose its animal edge.
France,Loire Valley,Cave Cooperative du Vendômois 2013 César de Vendôme Red (Coteaux du Vendômois),Red Blend,83,12.0,"Light in color, this tight, stalky wine is a blend of Pinot Noir, Cabernet Franc and Pineau d'Aunis. It comes from a region that is probably too cool for red wines, showing an herbal character that suggests underripe grapes. The wine might show better in a warmer vintage."
France,Loire Valley,Domaine Alban Roblin 2014  Sancerre,Pinot Noir,86,22.0,This ripe wine has spice as well as red-berry fruits. Good acidity combines with light tannins to deliver a balanced wine with a mineral edge that should age for a few more months. Drink from 2017.
France,Alsace,François Baur 2012 Sang du Dragon Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,89,28.0,"The merest hint of oak spice wafts from the nose. The palate has that softly oaked, spiced roundedness that adds cinnamon and a touch of vanilla to gentle but not overtly expressed berry notes. There is some tannic grip, too."

France,Alsace,Cave de Beblenheim NV Blanc de Noirs Heimberger Brut Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,89,,The honeyed notes on the nose almost have a savory soy-scented quality. These savory notes of stone and yeast also hover on the palate which is dry and replaces primary fruit with honeyed fluidity against the canvas of yeasty autolysis. This works not only as a dry refreshing apéritif but as an accompaniment to delicate foods.
France,Alsace,Cave de Cleebourg NV Clérostein Rosé Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,89,15.0,"Baked red currant and apple notes create a very appetizing nose. Their tart fruitiness mingles beautifully with the shortbread notes on the dry, refreshing palate and makes this almost impossible to put down. The finish is wonderfully clean and refreshing."
France,Alsace,Arthur Metz 2014 Brut Rosé Millesimé Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,89,20.0,"Faint notes of strawberry rise from the glass; on the palate they become more subdued and meld into fresh, citrusy notes of grapefruit. The combination of fine fizz, grown-up dryness and spiky citrus is absolutely convincing, even mouth-watering."
France,Southwest France,Producteurs Plaimont 2014 La Madeleine de Saint-Mont  (Saint-Mont),Red Blend,92,99.0,"From a small parcel of 19th-century vines planted on the hill of Saint-Mont, this is a finely structured rich wine. It has dark tannins and dense black fruits that are balanced by acidity. Rich, spicy and full, it still has tannins that will begin to soften shortly. Drink from 2018 until 2024."
France,Southwest France,L'Enclos des Braves 2015 L'Enclos Rouge Red (Gaillac),Red Blend,92,28.0,"From a small 19-acre estate, this is a fruity and juicy blend of Braucol and the still rare Prunelard.

France,Burgundy,Domaine Henri Delagrange 2014 Clos de Chênes Premier Cru  (Volnay),Pinot Noir,92,105.0,"With a fine balance between some rigorous tannins and a more generous black-fruit character, this is a wine both to appreciate now and to age. The wine is perfumed, with spice from the wood aging and mint and thyme aromas. This serious wine is just ready to drink, but that would be a shame, so wait until 2018."
France,Alsace,Willm NV Blanc de Noirs Brut Pinot Noir (Crémant d'Alsace),Pinot Noir,90,14.0,"This is a deliciously ripe, full-bodied wine with all the red berry fruits, orange zest and acidity that you could want. It's finely made with a creamy mousse and a fresh and fruity aftertaste."
France,France Other,J.P. Chenet 2015 Reserve Pinot Noir (Vin de France),Pinot Noir,84,10.0,"This is a solid and balanced wine, with lively aromas and flavors of red cherry, strawberry and banana. Light weight and easy drinking, the softly tannic structure transitions seamlessly into the clean, fruity finish."
France,France Other,Domaine de la Mordorée 2014 La Remise Red (Vin de France),Red Blend,84,13.0,"This 50-50 blend of Marselan and Merlot opens with aromas of raspberry-cran-apple juice and underripe cherry. The light palate offers lithe tannins and a tart, fruit-skin astringency that lingers through the close."
France,Burgundy,Manuel Olivier 2008  Aloxe-Corton,Pinot Noir,88,29.0,"A soft and deliciously jammy wine. It has immediately attractive ripe plum and berry fruits, layered with balancing acidity. The tannins sit well in the plump cushion of the wine. Not for aging."
France,Provence,Les Vignobles Gueissard 2011 Cuvée G Red (Bandol),Red Blend,90,25.0,"With its blend that includes perfumed Mourvèdre, this is a solidly tannic while also aromatic wine. It tastes of the garrigue and wild plants that surround the vineyards, giving both tannin and rich dark plum fruit flavors. It needs to age, so drink from 2016."
France,Alsace,Domaines Schlumberger 2015 Les Princes Abbés Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,89,27.0,"The nose just hints at earth and autumnal oak leaf. The palate comes with slight grip, very fine tannins and more earthy leafy aromas. Red-cherry fruit is just hinted at. This is slender and bone dry and will come into its own when served with subtle mushroom or game dishes."
France,Alsace,Henri Schoenheitz 2014 Saint Gregoire Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,89,20.0,The nose seems closed. There is just a hint of earthiness. The slender palate has edges of mocha and smoke that frame its fresh crisp tart red-cherry fruit. The body is light but held within a very fine-boned structure that leads to a dry clean finish.
France,Loire Valley,Domaines Tatin 2014 Les Demoiselles Tatin Pinot Noir (Reuilly),Pinot Noir,87,20.0,"Smooth and soft, this has light, fresh red-berry fruits laced with acidity and perfumed by red cherries. The structure is gentle and with the bright fruits, this succulent wine is ready to drink."
France,Loire Valley,Joseph Mellot 2014 Domaine des Emois  (Sancerre),Pinot Noir,87,30.0,"This wine has an initial strong tannic element that submerges the red fruits. As it opens, the wine reveals more juiciness, berry flavors and fresh acidity. It's still young and needs to be aged. Drink from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Louis Chevallier 2014  Morey-Saint-Denis,Pinot Noir,87,55.0,"Something of the structure of Morey is here in this wine. However it is surprisingly ready to drink, with the tannins in the background leaving the foreground to juicy red-berry fruits and fresh acidity. It is attractive and balanced; drink now."
France,Alsace,Domaine Sipp-Mack 2015 Tradition Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,88,27.0,"Hints of earth are the only aromas on the nose, which seems devoid of fruit. The palate has a similar leafy earthiness and slight berry aromas. There are bitter edges on the very slender, soft and easy body. This has a picnic-style rusticity about it and a very clean and dry finish."
France,Champagne,Jean Josselin NV Cordon Royal Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,90,37.0,"This is a Pinot Noir-dominated wine, with intense acidity as well as attractive, rich white fruits. There is a touch of maturity, of ripeness that gives the wine a full-bodied character. Add in some toastiness and this is a well-integrated wine that's ready to drink."
France,Champagne,Henriet-Bazin NV Blanc de Noirs Extra Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,91,73.0,"Produced from Grand Cru vineyards on the Montagne de Reims, this wine is rich, dry and tightly structured. A mineral texture gives a steely edge that is balanced by perfumed fruit with apple and creamed pear flavors."
France,Champagne,Jean Laurent 2003 Blanc de Noirs Millésime Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,91,100.0,"With the dominance of Pinot Noir in the Aube region, it is no surprise to find a vintage Champagne that is 100% from that grape. With a round character from the Pinot, as well as a hot vintage, this is a full-bodied wine with vibrant fruit and lively acidity. Drink now."
France,Burgundy,Philippe Pacalet 2014  Gevrey-Chambertin,Pinot Noir,92,110.0,"This wine from a densely planted southeast-facing vineyard is still firmly structured with a dry core of tannins. Its black cherry and plum fruit flavors are still developing yet show considerable potential. With its richness, it will age well. Drink from 2020."
France,Burgundy,David Duband 2014  Gevrey-Chambertin,Pinot Noir,92,85.0,"From the northern end of the Gevrey-Chambertin appellation, this wine is ripe, floral and supple in texture. It has crisp red fruit and vibrant acidity, underpinned by ripe tannins. Developing quickly, it will be ready to drink from 2019."
France,Provence,Château Romanin 2011 La Chapelle Red (Les Baux de Provence),Red Blend,86,,"This is a light, fresh wine that shows attractive acidity while also offering some firm tannins. It has a crisp edge, but not a great amount of depth, and will probably be ready to drink soon."
France,Burgundy,Domaines Devillard 2010 Le Renard  (Bourgogne),Pinot Noir,85,22.0,"Light and fruity, this has a fresh red-berry flavor. It has intense youthful acidity, lending a very crisp texture. With its soft tannins, it is ready to drink in a few months when the acidity has calmed down."
France,Burgundy,L. Tramier & Fils 2012  Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Beaune,Pinot Noir,86,,"From the slopes high on the hillside above Beaune, this is a soft and ripe wine. Fruity and smoky, it has some richer berry flavors to broaden it out. Good acidity makes the wine fresh, fruity and ready to drink in 2015."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Des Meix Porons 2014 Les Pimentiers  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,89,39.0,"From vines in the plain between Corton and Beaune, this wine is full of ripe red fruits. Its soft, rounded character is spiced with acidity and the wood aging. Soft tannins fill the texture. Drink from 2018."
France,Alsace,Cave de Ribeauvillé NV Giersberger Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,88,23.0,"Fresh lemony notes are signalled on the nose and fizz on the simple, fruit-driven palate. There is an element of creaminess but the frothing mouthfeel is all about refreshment and easy fruit."
France,Champagne,Charles-Gilbert de Vindé NV Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,88,54.0,"This crisp, dry rosé brings out citrus and orange fruits as much as red berries and red currants. It is tight and lightly mineral in texture, with a touch of tannin from the 100% Pinot Noir. The wine is ready to drink."
France,Burgundy,Henri de Villamont 2014  Grands-Echezeaux,Pinot Noir,94,,"Firm and structured, this still shows much of the ripe red fruit of the vintage. It has a round, warm feel, along with weight and density. Fresh berry flavors cut through the powerful texture. Drink from 2023."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Coquard Loisson-Fleurot 2014  Clos de la Roche,Pinot Noir,94,130.0,"For its small size, Morey Saint-Denis is blessed with four Grand Cru vineyards, of which this is arguably the finest. The wine's spice and wood flavors are still evident, although these will get well integrated into the rich red-fruit flavor. It is certainly still young and should not be drunk before 2022."
France,Burgundy,Albert Morot 2014 Les Cent Vignes Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,93,65.0,"Rich and juicy, this wine holds excellent potential. With its ripe red-berry fruit, balanced tannins and acidity, and spice from the wood aging, it will become a concentrated wine. Drink from 2020."
France,Burgundy,Château de Santenay 2014 Clos du Roi Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,93,55.0,"Situated in the northern part of the Côte de Beaune, the vines produce soft, ripe wines. This wine is typical of this style with just enough tannins to bolster the rich berry fruits. It features a juicy backdrop along with touches of wood and spice. It needs time; drink from 2020."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Faiveley 2014 Clos de l'Ecu Premier Cru Monopole  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,93,76.0,"A generous wine, this is packed with red fruits as well as firmly structured. It conveys the fresh acidity of the year, with fine smoky tannins. It will be an impressive wine. Drink from 2020."
France,Burgundy,Louis Jadot 2010  Pommard,Pinot Noir,88,65.0,"A dense, firm selection, this has layers of red fruits and acids that help to give the wine's skeleton some flesh. This is likely to develop into a rich, but always firm, wine."
France,Burgundy,Jaffelin 2009  Volnay,Pinot Noir,88,42.0,"Earthy, soft and ripe, this wine shows the richness of the vintage. It is full of red plum and red jelly flavors, and the tannins are dusty in the background. The acidity holds it all together, and the finish is juicy and fruity."
France,Loire Valley,Joseph Mellot 2012 Domaine des Emois  (Sancerre),Pinot Noir,86,30.0,"Raspberry fruits and juicy acidity are allied to a softly tannic structure to give a ripe while fresh wine. It's fruity but with a firm, dry core that gives the potential to age 2016–2017."
France,Champagne,Henriet-Bazin NV Blanc de Noirs Grand Cru Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,91,68.0,"With the weight expected from a 100% Pinot Noir wine, this is rich while also textured with tight minerality and tense acidity. It is dry, concentrated with the weight of two Grand Cru vineyards behind it. The wine is just ready to drink, although it will show well with a few more months in bottle."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Roger Belland 2011 Les Charmes  (Santenay),Pinot Noir,86,50.0,This is a ripe and juicy wine. It has ripe wild strawberry flavors that go with the full-bodied feeling and the warm tannins. It's rich and developing well. Drink from 2016.
France,Burgundy,Joseph Drouhin 2012  Pommard,Pinot Noir,90,65.0,"With the next two vintages both damaged by hail, 2012 is the most recent normal crop from Pommard. This structured and solid wine seems to have an excess of wood at this stage, although the ripe red berry fruits do give a more generous character. The tannins, typical of Pommard, kick in—although not enough to spoil the fruitiness. Drink from 2016."
France,Burgundy,Domaine de la Pousse d'Or 2009 Corton Bressandes  (Corton-Bressandes),Pinot Noir,94,163.0,"Dense, weighty and concentrated now, this wine will become opulent once the surface tannins finally integrate. The wine is superrich, with chocolate and licorice partnering with the intense fruit."
France,Burgundy,Jaffelin 2009  Chambolle-Musigny,Pinot Noir,85,64.0,"A tight wine, this is dominated by acids, red fruits and firm tannins, and it's missing some of the richness of the vintage. It has a closed feeling, and it needs some months to develop, but this will always be dry."
France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot 2010 Secret de Famille  (Bourgogne),Pinot Noir,85,,"This is a firm wine, but it has ripe red fruit. It shows an attractive touch of smoke, and there is fine balance between the firm tannins and fragrant fruit. Drink now."
France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Gérard Bertrand 2008 Syrah/Carignan Red (Minervois),Red Blend,89,18.0,"The nose is loaded with garrigue aromas, mostly rosemary and dried bay leaf, lifted by vibrant black cherry and black berry jam. Licorice and spice unfold in the chewy mouth, with a decadent milk chocolate infused finish."
France,Southwest France,Domaine Rotier 2014 Esquisse Red (Gaillac),Red Blend,86,15.0,"A wine that smells so fruity, and with a soft, open texture, needs to be drunk young. This wine is all red berries coupled with acidity and some smoky tannins. It's a great idea to chill it slightly."
France,Alsace,Hugel 2011 Grossi Laüe Limited Edition Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,94,55.0,"A pure startling cherry note rises from the glass. It is flanked by notes of autumn forest, tar and dried orange rind. Evidently, there is some development and evolution here. The palate is alive and fills not only the mouth but all the senses with its alluring aromas, yet it is firmly anchored in earthier tones. The body is svelte and fresh: its fine-boned structure is as much down to fresh acidity as it is to finely flexed tannins. This is profound, lasting and delicious but also deliciously light."
France,Southwest France,Jean-Luc Baldès 2008 Clos Triguedina Baldès Red (Cahors),Red Blend,88,,"A firmly structured wine, revealing all the Malbec tannic character. The extra year's aging has rounded the wine, filling it out with black tarry fruit. It is firm and dense, with good richness."
France,Burgundy,Manuel Olivier 2012  Chambolle-Musigny,Pinot Noir,89,80.0,"Exhibiting the natural richness of a Chambolle wine, this is a work in progress. Tannins are still integrating with the generous red fruits and acidity to give the ripe and rounded wine it will become. Drink from 2017."
France,Burgundy,Manuel Olivier 2012  Morey-Saint-Denis,Pinot Noir,89,50.0,"Still young, this is potentially a full and rich wine. It has the structure typical of Morey, with firm tannins and a good depth of cherry and red fruit flavors topped by acidity. The tannins are still firm and the wine needs to age, so drink from 2017."
France,Burgundy,Michel Gros 1999 Clos des Reas  (Vosne-Romanée),Pinot Noir,93,65.0,"This lovely wine, a Monopole, is already showing complex, forward fruit with flavors of plum, cherry and cranberry. Soft and fulsome, it shows a light hand with the oak, allowing nuances of tobacco and leather to emerge. Good weight and texture, it seems bound for early glory."
France,Burgundy,Daniel Rion 1999 Les Beaux-Monts  (Vosne-Romanée),Pinot Noir,92,52.0,"Rion holds back on the new oak, letting the pure, supple fruit speak for itself. This is a muscular Vosne, young and firm, showing excellent focus and structure. Already the finish lingers beautifully, with layers of texture and tightly wrapped fruit. Should cellar well for a decade or more."
France,Burgundy,Michel Gros 1999 Aux Brulees  (Vosne-Romanée),Pinot Noir,90,65.0,"Another premier cru from Michel Gros, this one not as elegant and fruity as the Réas. Instead it goes for more ripeness, more tannic weight, and a lot more roasted scents from the barrels. Big, rawboned but undeniably appealing, it has a lot of rough-hewn flavor, dominated by toast, tannin and tobacco."
France,Burgundy,Daniel Rion 1999 Clos dea Argillieres  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,89,52.0,"This is a lovely, fragrant Burgundy, with a smoky/cherry scented nose leading into a rather tight, hard young wine. Hints of rosewater, graham cracker and tobacco are there, along with some green tannins. Medium body and texture; needs more time to show its best stuff."
France,Burgundy,Michel Gros 1999  Chambolle-Musigny,Pinot Noir,89,38.0,"Scents of graham cracker and malted milk chocolate tickle the nose, while the tart fruit slowly unwinds to reveal cherry and beetroot scents and flavors. Tannic and hard, without immediately showing much sweetness, it seems to put the emphasis on mineral and soil, root and leaf, but may evolve into a very interesting wine."
France,Burgundy,Michel Gros 1999 Les Chaliots  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,87,37.0,"This needs a good bit of breathing time, then it begins to reveal some cherry lifesaver fruit and a balanced structure with firm acids and medium tannins. A bit chalky in the finish, it's a relatively light style that is pleasant and pretty once it has opened up."
France,Burgundy,Daniel Rion 1999 Les Charmes  (Chambolle-Musigny),Pinot Noir,87,65.0,"The nose is dominated by the attractive scents of new French oak, with some hints of pipe tobacco and just a whiff of volatile acidity. It is tight and tannic, a bit ""lifted"" with the VA, and at this point not showing much fruit or complexity, given the price."
France,Southwest France,Domaine de Pellehaut 2016 Harmonie de Gascogne Red (Côtes de Gascogne),Red Blend,84,12.0,"This is a stalky light wine. With black-currant fruit and layers of intense acidity, it is fruity with a cool crisp aftertaste. Drink now."
France,France Other,Pierre Moulin NV Pinot Noir (Vin de France),Pinot Noir,82,13.0,"An assertive medicinal character dominates the bouquet of this wine, with secondary notes of overripe red berries and strawberry. A fruit leather and Jolly Rancher-like quality overwhelms the palate, while the finish is surprisingly sharp and short."
France,France Other,L'original French Kiss NV Cabernet Sauvignon (Vin de France),Cabernet Sauvignon,81,11.0,"Initial medicinal notes of cherry cough syrup partner with scents of cherry Jolly Rancher and red rope licorice. The smooth, slick palate feels overdone, offering more of those sweet red-fruit flavors, but it finishes fast."
France,France Other,Le Val 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Vin de France),Cabernet Sauvignon,81,10.0,"Sweet oak aromas of vanilla extract, pencil shaving and cocoa butter flood the nose, overshadowing any pure fruit character. Soft and broad in texture, it has plum spice and sweet wood flavors that fade fast on the close."
France,Loire Valley,Jean-Max Roger 2010 Cuvée La Grange Dimière  (Sancerre),Pinot Noir,89,28.0,"Nicely mature, this is a ripe red-fruit and spice-flavored wine. Soft tannins merge with the fruit to give a wine that is balanced with a fragrant, juicy aftertaste. Drink now."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Julie Belland 2011 Beauregard Premier Cru  (Santenay),Pinot Noir,89,40.0,"The wine is completely mature. With soft strawberry flavors that have melded into the rounded texture, this is a wine that has only the lightest tannins. Acidity and an attractive ripe fruit character make this a wine to enjoy now."
France,Loire Valley,Chavet Fils 2012 Cuvée Exception  (Menetou-Salon),Pinot Noir,84,25.0,"Touches of toast and tannin give enough structure. The red berry fruits taste firm and extracted, giving a bitter edge. It's a wine that brings out the structured character of Pinot Noir rather than its fruit."
France,France Other,Vinadeis 2016 Le Val Cabernet Sauvignon (Vin de France),Cabernet Sauvignon,84,12.0,"This stalky wine has black currant fruit and touches of spice and toast. Acidity and tannins are present, offering texture and a crisp finish that make it approachable for drinking now."
France,France Other,Florent Descombe NV Cabernet Sauvignon (Vin de France),Cabernet Sauvignon,84,16.0,"Simple and fruity yet lacking in acidity, this is a soft style of Cabernet Sauvignon. It's fruity, with strawberry jelly flavor, and should be drunk immediately."
France,Burgundy,Maison Jessiaume 2008  Clos de Vougeot,Pinot Noir,93,105.0,"Rich, packed with  juicy fruit. The wine has weight, depth of fruit flavor and tannins as a central core. A smoky character indicates the wood aging, packing in with the acidity and black cherry fruits on the finish. Age for 5–8 years."
France,Southwest France,Domaine de Gensac 2012 Piaffer Red (Gers),Red Blend,89,27.0,"A blend that includes Syrah and Tannat as well as Bordeaux grapes, this is a wood-aged, ripe and rich wine. A tense streak of acidity heightens the effect of the black currant fruits. Spice at the end comes from the wood. Drink from 2016."
France,Burgundy,Joseph Faiveley 2010  Bourgogne,Pinot Noir,85,24.0,"Light and fruity, this wine has red fruit and a tannic edge, and bright acidity that gives definition to the fruit. Ready to drink now."
France,France Other,Patriarche Père et Fils 2015 Pinot Noir (Vin de France),Pinot Noir,87,10.0,"The Burgundy-based producer has made a fresh, cherry-flavored wine that is identifiably Pinot Noir. It has soft tannins and a dry core, yet is dominated by red fruit and acidity on the finish. Drink now."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Perrot-Minot 2010  Chapelle-Chambertin,Pinot Noir,95,,"Using grapes sourced from 80-year-old vines, this is a rich, powerful wine, with juicy, generous black fruits. The big tannins are right upfront, lending a solid, dense texture. Gentle black fruits and acidity emerge on the finish."
France,Loire Valley,Domaine Matthias et Emile Roblin 2012 Grande Côte de la Vallée  (Sancerre),Pinot Noir,87,,"This is a perfumed, stalky wine. It suggests fragrant red fruits and crushed raspberry flavors that contrast with the smoky flavor and strong acidity. At the end, red currants dominate."
France,Southwest France,Domaine Rotier 2012 Les Gravels Red (Gaillac),Red Blend,89,19.0,"This blend of local Duras and Braucol with the more Mediterranean Syrah is attractively spicy and juicy. It is packed with red fruits, sweet berry flavors and ripe tannins. The wine is maturing well and will be ready to drink from 2016."
France,Loire Valley,Domaine Vincent Pinard 2014  Sancerre,Pinot Noir,92,42.0,"This is a smooth, rich wine with just the right amount of tannic structure and wood flavors to add complexity. It has density along with red berry and black-cherry fruits that are lifted by acidity. It's a wine for aging, so don't drink before 2018."
France,Southwest France,Domaine de Lartigue 2011 Red (Côtes de Gascogne),Red Blend,86,,"This wine is all fruit with a stalky character that comes from fresh black currants, tight acidity and dusty tannins. It's light and forward—a cool red that will be ready to drink later this year."
France,Southwest France,Producteurs Plaimont 2009 Les Vignes Retrouvées  (Saint-Mont),Red Blend,86,11.0,"A blend of Tannat, Pinenc and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a ripe, earthy wine. It has rich black fruits that show concentrated tannins while also promising a smoother ride in a few years."
France,Burgundy,L. Tramier & Fils 2015 Collection Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,90,73.0,"This is a blend from different Premier Cru vineyards in Beaune. At this stage, it is dominated by the wood aging. That gives a bitterness to the wine that needs to soften and allow the ripe fruit to come out. It does have potential, although the maturity will take time. Drink from 2019."
France,France Other,Yves Leccia 2013 E Croce Red (Patrimonio),Red Blend,90,36.0,"This wine is full, structured and still developing, with a bitter-chocolate edge that give a sharp character. This is balanced with warmer black-fruit flavors and acidity. The wine has great potential and needs another year. It will be best from the end of 2017."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Sylvain Pataille 2010  Marsannay,Pinot Noir,88,26.0,"A fruity style of wine, this has red berry flavors and only touches of structure and tannin. The wine is warm and round, packed with fruit on the finish."
France,Burgundy,Labouré-Roi 2015  Pommard,Pinot Noir,89,60.0,This attractively perfumed wine shows the structure of Pommard without pushing too strongly. It has ripe red plum and cherry fruit that will balance the tannins as it ages. Drink from 2020.
France,Burgundy,Laroze de Drouhin 2010 Les Charmottes  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,88,,"This has soft tannins, ripe fruit and fresh acidity, with a dominant berry flavor. For a Nuits-St-Georges, this is quite open."
France,Burgundy,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2015 Domaine Aegerter  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,90,70.0,Nuits Saint-Georges is the home of the Aegerter family and its Domaine. This ripe spicy smoky wine is rich both from the vintage and from the core of tannins that are typical of the appellation. It is a smooth rounded wine although it will need some aging. Drink from 2020.
France,Burgundy,Maison Jessiaume 2015  Volnay,Pinot Noir,90,40.0,"While the producer does have vines in Volnay, this wine comes from the negociant side of the business. The wine has structure and some firm tannins. At this stage, the Volnay roundness lies behind the dry surface. But it does have weight and the potential to age well. Drink from 2021."
France,Burgundy,Louis Jadot 2011 Le Vaucrain  (Côte de Nuits-Villages),Pinot Noir,85,39.0,"The acidity is most obvious at this stage of the wine's development. It does have structure, but it feels cool and tight. A green edge at the back adds to the cool character."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Michel et Joanna Ecard 2011 Vieilles Vignes  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,85,,"This wine is rather too jammy and ripe for its own good. It does have acidity, but it is also soft without the essential structure. It's not a wine for aging."
France,Loire Valley,Roger et Didier Raimbault 2010  Sancerre,Pinot Noir,87,45.0,"Smooth and softly textured, this is an attractive red wine. It has ripe berry fruits, gentle tannins that are enough to bring out the wood and spice flavors. Give the wine two years."
France,Languedoc-Roussillon,O'Vineyards 2006 Proprietor's Reserve Red (Cabardes),Red Blend,90,24.0,"Loads of menthol and pepper spice fill the nose, with a supporting fruit core of black cherry, black currant and wild raspberry. The texture is like crushed satin but the tannins, though fine grain, have good staying power. Mocha and cherry pits add character to the close."
France,Provence,Le Classique from the 3 Springs Vineyard 2005 Red (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence),Red Blend,88,20.0,"Intensely perfumed wine, with spicy Syrah aromas dominating this blend with Grenache and Cabernet Sauvignon. There's also an earthiness to the wine, which is still young. The tannins comes through with black fruits, fresh acidity, and some firm ripeness. Age for 3–4 years."
France,Southwest France,Georges Vigouroux 2005 Château Leret Monpezat Red (Cahors),Red Blend,88,12.0,"Very young, dominated by its bitter tannins, then with tight blackberry fruits. It is like a coiled runner, waiting to sprint, its freshness promising a good development. It certainly needs time."
France,Southwest France,Château Bellevue la Forêt 2012 Red (Fronton),Red Blend,88,12.0,"There is an interesting mix of grapes here —with Cabernet Sauvignon with Bordeaux origins blended with the local Négrette and with the Syrah more commonly found in the Rhône. Such is the eclectic nature of Southwest France vineyards. The wine itself is mature, soft and fruity, with light tannins and a perfumed edge. The red-plum fruits are juicy, ripe and with an attractive balance of acidity. Drink now."
France,Provence,Château Romanin 2006 Red (Les Baux de Provence),Red Blend,88,,"Now mature, this is a wine with weight and richness. It shows concentration in its juicy, but maturing, fruit flavors. The wine has layers of tannin still, so could age well for a few years more."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Jean Petitot et Fils 2011 Les Vignottes  (Côte de Nuits-Villages),Pinot Noir,86,41.0,"The wine is structured and still firm, showing tight tannins and acidity over the red fruits. A cool edge elicits the fresher character of the fruits. Drink from 2016."
France,Burgundy,Bouchard Père & Fils 2012 Réserve  (Bourgogne),Pinot Noir,86,20.0,This fruity wine features strawberry and bitter cherry flavors. A lightly tannic structure accompanies a very fragrant and smoky character. Wood shows through at the end. Drink from 2015.
France,Burgundy,Domaine Olivier Merlin 2011  Bourgogne,Pinot Noir,86,20.0,"This small domaine in the Mâcon region has produced a soft, ripe wine with attractive strawberry fruits. It's rounded, with just light acidity over the fruit flavors. At the end, it feels warm and ripe. Drink now."
France,Southwest France,Domaine des Terrisses 2014 Grande Tradition Red (Gaillac),Red Blend,91,15.0,"This intensely fresh red wine is a blend of Duras, Braucol and Syrah in a textured, stalky style that is tight and layered with tannins. It's certainly young, still bursting with fruit and needing to fill out as its tannins soften and its black currant fruit calms down. Then it will be a fascinating, complex wine, elegant and poised. Drink from 2018."
France,Southwest France,Cave du Marmandais 2014 Château la Vieille Eglise Red (Côtes du Marmandais),Red Blend,90,15.0,"The vineyards of Marmande are on the north bank of the Garonne River, east of Bordeaux. This wine, produced by the cooperative from a single vineyard, is dense, concentrated and full of both fine fruit and tannins. It has juicy black fruits that are sustained by the dusty texture. The aftertaste with its acidity is fresh and fruity. Drink from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Chanson Père et Fils 2013 Bastion Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,91,59.0,"A rounded wine, this is a blend of different premier-cru vineyards in Beaune. It packed with raspberries and red cherries. The acidity, typical of the year, is restrained here by the ripe fruitiness. Tannins give the wine just the right amount of support."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Bruno Clair 2014 Vaudenelles  (Marsannay),Pinot Noir,91,,"This juicy wine has attractive red fruits, perfumed tannins and lots of spicy wood flavors. Those characteristics make it already balanced and indicate a bright and fruity future. The wood gives the right density to the wine and the aftertaste adds freshness."
France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot 2014 Les Evocelles  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,91,80.0,"With structure and some firm tannins, this wine is on the dry side.

France,Burgundy,Joseph Drouhin 2005  Gevrey-Chambertin,Pinot Noir,90,48.0,"A charged Burgundy, packed with dense tannins and powerful ripe black berry fruits. There's a delicious tension here between the fruits and the tannin, pushing the acidity, the red plums and strawberries forward, but keeping them in check. At this stage, it needs decanting; otherwise keep for 2–3 years."
France,Burgundy,Manuel Olivier 2010 Premier Cru  (Pommard),Pinot Noir,89,71.0,"There is a sense of extraction and long wood aging with this bitter, chocolate-flavored wine. The palate has a dark plum-skin fruit character and a dry, hard-edged core. It will need at least six years to mature."

France,Burgundy,Au Pied du Mont Chauve 2012 Clos des Fietres  (Corton),Pinot Noir,93,140.0,"This wine is dense and still firm, although the red-berry fruits are being to integrate well into the structure.

France,Burgundy,Manuel Olivier 2011  Nuits-St.-Georges,Pinot Noir,89,50.0,"Ripe with a core of dry tannins, this is a typical foursquare Nuits-Saint-Georges. Structure gives shape to the black fruits and acidity that are developing well. Already in balance, it will be drinkable from 2016."
France,Burgundy,Manuel Olivier 2012  Aloxe-Corton,Pinot Noir,89,50.0,"Enticingly perfumed, this is full of red cherry and plum fruits that are cut through with intense acidity.

France,Burgundy,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2012 Bélissand Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,91,74.0,"Well structured, this combines ripe red fruits with a firm texture.

France,Burgundy,Domaine Faiveley 2011 Clos de Myglands Premier Cru  (Mercurey),Pinot Noir,90,45.0,"This ripe and fruity wine comes from Faiveley's wholly-owned vineyard in Mercurey.

France,Burgundy,Labouré-Roi 2013  Nuits-St.-Georges,Pinot Noir,87,45.0,"While the wine does have some dry tannins, it is surprisingly light and soft for a Nuits-Saint-Georges. Red cherry flavors are already as important as the acidity and the dry core. That means this is not a wine for long-term aging, so drink from 2017. This is one of the first vintages since Labouré-Roi, which was hit by scandal in 2012, passed into new ownership."

The finish is dry and satisfying.
France,Alsace,Domaine Albert Mann 2009 Clos de la Faille Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,89,,"With some earthy aromas, this is a rich wine. It has weight, layers of wood and attractive strawberry flavor. The fruitiness is contained within a firm tannin shell that suggests the wine could age."

It is balanced with the red-cherry fruit and acidity. Named after the constable who controlled the castle of Sancerre in the Middle Ages, the wine is dense with tannins as well as the fruit.

France,Southwest France,Château la Caminade 2006 Red (Cahors),Red Blend,88,14.0,"A beefy wine, solid and structured. The tannins are dense, very dry, packed with the juiciest of black fruits, and promising a year or two's aging. There is a hint of perfume from wood and sweet fruits. A great wine for rich meats."

France,Burgundy,Bouchard Père & Fils 2007 Aux Malconsorts Premier Cru  (Vosne-Romanée),Pinot Noir,92,145.0,"A tannins-dominated wine, firm and dry. The fruit is relatively subdued, with a juicy character of raspberries, red plum skins and crisp acidity. This is a wine that needs aging to soften those tannins: give it 4–5 years."
France,Burgundy,Bouchard Père & Fils 2007 Caillerets Premier Cru Ancienne Cuvée Carnot  (Volnay),Pinot Noir,92,89.0,"A solid wine, showing some generosity and richness, the fruits displaying a fine balance between sweetness, dry tannins and bright acidity. It has some of the sensuous character of good Volnay, opening into ripeness. Worth aging for several years, but already offering considerable pleasure."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Françoise André 2015 Les Vergelsess Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,90,58.0,"This smoky wine is ripe with a fine balance between tannins and rich red fruits.

France,Burgundy,Domaine Rossignol-Trapet 2015 Les Bas Liards  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,90,,"Concentrated tannins balance this juicy red-berry flavor wine. The wine is still very young, showing its tannins strongly. They will certainly integrate. Drink this potentially rich wine from 2022."
France,Loire Valley,Roger et Didier Raimbault 2014  Sancerre,Pinot Noir,90,35.0,"A ripe and rich wine, this is full of jammy red fruits. The structure is well integrated into the fruits, giving a smooth, ripe wine that's developing attractively. With a juicy, fresh aftertaste, it is ready to drink, although it will be better from 2017."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Maillard 2013  Corton,Pinot Noir,93,104.0,The initial impression is of toast and spice. Only slowly do the fruit and full-bodied richness of this wine become apparent. It comes from a Grand Cru close to Corton-Charlemagne and has similar structure and power. The wine will develop slowly and richly. Drink it from 2020.
France,Burgundy,Château de Santenay 2012 Montée Rouge Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,93,50.0,"This is a concentrated wine, full with dry tannins and perfumed red fruits. Hints of the wood aging give the wine toast and smokiness. The fresh fruits form a contrast offering a future of fragrance and stylishness. It needs to age, so wait until 2019."
France,Alsace,Sipp Mack 2011 Tradition Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,87,20.0,"With bitter cherry flavor and a light touch of tannin, this is a fruity, spicy wine. It has a cool climate feel of acidity and tight texture, while also being light and fresh. Drink now."

France,Alsace,Domaine François Schmitt NV Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Crémant d'Alsace),Pinot Noir,87,28.0,"Very pale in color, this spice and red-fruit flavored wine is refreshing and crisp. It's a light wine, cut through by acidity and floral undertones. Drink this attractive wine now."
France,Southwest France,Clos Triguedina 2005 Red (Cahors),Red Blend,90,49.0,"Still young, this wine shows the firm tannins of ripe Malbec, allied with some equally tannic Tannat. At this stage its berry fruits and acidity will cut through grilled red meats with ease. In 4–5 years, the richness of the wine will come through."
France,Southwest France,Domaine Rotier 2004 Renaissance Red (Gaillac),Red Blend,90,26.0,"This is a fascinating wine, just by reading the list of grapes in the blend: Duras, Braucol, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon. The first two, local grapes, lend a rough edge of tannins, which demands aging, but also give flavors of herbs, wild thyme and solid meaty character. The roundness comes from the ripe Syrah, which adds perfume."
France,Loire Valley,Xavier Flouret 2006 Domaine de Châtenoy Rouge Noir  (Menetou-Salon),Pinot Noir,88,24.0,"Close to Sancerre, Menetou-Salon produces a soft style of Pinot Noir, the acidity tamed by fresh tannins and loganberry fruits. A hint of wood gives extra weight."
France,France Other,Florent Descombe NV Pinot Noir (Vin de France),Pinot Noir,84,16.0,"This wine is lightly structured with tannins and shows red berry and cherry fruit, although with little varietal character. It's attractively juicy due to its acidity and perfumed aftertaste. Drink now."
France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot 2005 Domaine du Clos Frantin  (Clos de Vougeot),Pinot Noir,93,,"Deliciously rich and fruity, this is a wine that shows that Clos de Vougeot is a great vineyard. It has all the ripeness, the big, generous fruit, supported by wood. The berry flavors are intense, pierced through with acidity, and the denseness of the wine promises good aging."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Moillard 2005 Beaux-Monts Premier Cru  (Vosne-Romanée),Pinot Noir,93,125.0,"Big, juicy fruit, bolstered by tannins, gives this wine weight and impressive structure. There is a dry core surrounded by ripe plums, herbs and fresh spices , resulting in soft, juicy freshness. But those tannins promise aging potential."
France,Burgundy,Pierre Morey 2005 Santenots Premier Cru  (Volnay),Pinot Noir,92,95.0,"Initially earthy aromas give way to red fruits. The wine follows the same pattern, the barnyard flavors opening out with the ripe red plum and strawberry fruits. There is a delicious richness here, balanced with acidity and firm tannins."
France,Burgundy,Alex Gambal 2013  Chambolle-Musigny,Pinot Noir,90,85.0,"This wine is generous, rounded and soft. Rich red fruits dominate, exploding in the mouth with red cherry and raspberry flavors. It is a soft wine, perfumed with delicious, forward fruitiness. Drink from 2017."
France,Burgundy,Henri de Villamont 2012 Clos des Guettes Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,89,41.0,"Soft tannins and a rounded texture make this wine almost drinkable now.

France,Burgundy,Bouchard Père & Fils 2007 Beaune Grèves Premier Cru Vigne de l'Enfant Jésus  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,91,118.0,"One of Bouchard's signature wines, this is beautifully textured, a series of bright fruits, strawberries and sweet acidity. There are tannins, but this is lighter than in some vintages, a wine for short-term aging."
France,Burgundy,Bouchard Père & Fils 2007 Les Cailles Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,91,114.0,"An already complete wine, the tannins well integrated into the firm black fruits and acidity. It is foursquare but also has a richness that comes from wood as well as lively final freshness."
France,Burgundy,Camille Giroud 2008 Charmes Chambertin  (Charmes-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,94,168.0,"A solid structure and layers of dense fruit characterize this wine. Rich acidity, red cherry flavor and a dry, dark tannic core are surrounded by juicy red berry fruits and the freshest finish."

This is a big, ripe, solid wine whose perfumes give an enticing exotic aftertaste."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Jean Grivot 2013  Echézeaux,Pinot Noir,96,,"This wine is very young, still with layers of wood. It is going to be a structured, dense and packed with a strong mineral texture. To contrast, generous red plum fruits and intense acidity are ready to convey a deep, rich character. Drink this impressive wine from 2019"
France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Gérard Bertrand 2006 Réserve Spéciale Pinot Noir (Vin de Pays d'Oc),Pinot Noir,86,13.0,"A more serious attempt at crafting a good Pinot Noir in Languedoc-Roussillon and quite a successful one as well. Vanilla dominates the nose but yields to cherry pie filling and cherry jam flavors in the mouth. Mineral and strawberry notes shine through on the crisp, moderately long finish."
France,Burgundy,Domaines Devillard 2011 Clos du Cellier aux Moines Premier Cru  (Givry),Pinot Noir,88,40.0,"The vineyards of the 13th century abbey of La Ferté produces some of the best Givry.

France,France Other,Simonnet-Febvre 2012 Pinot Noir (Vin de France),Pinot Noir,85,15.0,"This is a blend of Pinot Noir from Burgundy and the south of France, giving a warm and rich character with soft tannins and juicy red plum fruit flavors.

France,Burgundy,Domaine de l'Arlot 2005 Les Petits Plets  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,87,,"Dense and structured via dark, dry tannins, this is a big wine, showing power but not great subtlety. If you want solid Burgundy, this is the wine."
France,Burgundy,Louis Latour 2005  Morey-Saint-Denis,Pinot Noir,87,60.0,"This light, fresh wine, with its concentration on raspberry flavors, has lifted acidity and an edge of bitterness. The tannins are there, but relatively subdued, so it's likely to age quickly."
France,Burgundy,Domaines Devillard 2011 Le Renard  (Bourgogne),Pinot Noir,85,23.0,"A fruity wine, just touched by some wood aging with attractive strawberry fruit flavors and acidity. It's not a wine for aging, its light minerality enhancing the fruitiness."
France,Alsace,Domaine Robert Klingenfus 2015 Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,86,15.0,"Very easy, slightly confected cherry fruit comes immediately to the fore. The palate has the same candy-ish notion countered with lots of freshness. The body is light, translucent and off dry. Drink soon while berryish aromas are at their peak."
France,Alsace,Domaine Fernand Engel 2015 Meyerhof Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,86,40.0,The nose is rather closed and just hints at crunchy cherries. The palate has ample red-cherry fruit but lacks a little definition and sports a slightly bitter edge. The body is dry and juicy. Drink soon.
France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Château de Jau 2002 Jaja Red (Vin de Pays d'Oc),Red Blend,82,9.0,"This blend of Syrah and Grenache has minty, wet-plaster aromas, but also some pure Grenache notes. The palate runs tart, with cranberry and cherry. And the finish is tight and bitter, with more acids than tannin. A viable bistro wine but go no further."
France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Val d'Orbieu 2001 Reserve St. Martin Cabernet Sauvignon (Languedoc),Cabernet Sauvignon,82,8.0,"Cherry, plum and earth aromas lead into a tart, lean palate that struggles to offer more than a modicum of cherry and cassis flavors. The finish is sweet and spicy, which makes for an odd, not terribly appealing combination."
France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Château Camplazens 1999 La Garrigue - La Clape Controlle Red (Coteaux du Languedoc),Red Blend,82,13.0,"Light and oaky at first, with earth notes. But then it goes awkward, showing imbalanced berry and plum fruit and overt oak. The wine shows some complexity and style, but at the same time it's all over the place, with hard tannins that subtract from the final tally."
France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Michel Picard 2001 Cabernet Sauvignon (Languedoc),Cabernet Sauvignon,81,9.0,"Big but murky; there just isn't much focus to this leathery, full-fruit bruiser that seems to draw its energy from a powerful beam of acidity that runs through the center of things. Short on balance and charm, but big on extract and tannins."
France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Les Vignerons de la Méditerranée 2004 Cuvée Mythique Réserve Red (Corbières),Red Blend,88,22.0,"This has been a steady source over the years for reasonably rich, satisfying wines from the Languedoc. The 2004 Réserve has a velvety feel to its tannins, giving it a touch more polish than usual, plus dark flavors of leather, cola and earth--even a hint of bacon on the finish. Drink it over the next few years."
France,Alsace,Huber & Bléger NV Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Crémant d'Alsace),Pinot Noir,84,22.0,An attractive yet fresh sparkling Pinot Noir rosé. It has a fine balance with its acidity well integrated into the raspberry fruit flavors. There's just an edge of bitterness that spoils the aftertaste.
France,Loire Valley,Joseph Mellot 2012 Clos du Pressoir  (Menetou-Salon),Pinot Noir,84,25.0,"Rather stalky, this dry wine has a sense of extraction in the form of bitterness. The wine's red fruits are behind this dryness, demanding at least another 2–3 years."
France,Loire Valley,Roland Tissier et Fils 2014 Tradition  (Sancerre),Pinot Noir,84,27.0,This lean wine focuses more on its stalky texture rather than fruit. It has some attractive perfumes and hints of red fruits that are subdued by the austere structure. Drink from 2017.
France,Loire Valley,Clement et Florian Berthier 2014 Pinot Noir (Coteaux du Giennois),Pinot Noir,84,15.0,"While the wine is ripe, it does have a barnyard aroma that needs to blow away before it is ready to drink. The aroma comes with firm, dry tannins and a ripe berry fruits that are just beginning to develop. Drink from 2017."
France,Champagne,Jean Josselin NV Cuvée des Jean Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,85,30.0,"This is a pure Pinot Noir cuvée from an Aube-based producer. It has a curious candied character reminiscent of fruit drops due, perhaps, to its youth. Give it a few more months to gain depth and drink from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Domaines Devillard 2014 Château de Chamirey En Sazenay Premier Cru  (Mercurey),Pinot Noir,93,50.0,"This is a ripe wine, packing tannins as well as black fruits into a rich package. Black cherries and black plums are paired with a core of dry tannins. The acidity comes right through to give the wine its potential. The wine comes from a very stony vineyard and this shows in its tight mineral aftertaste. Drink from 2019."
France,Burgundy,Capitain-Gagnerot 2008 Les Moutottes Premier Cru  (Aloxe-Corton),Pinot Noir,93,45.0,It is rare to find mature red Burgundy being sold directly from the producer's cellar. This 2008 from an above-average vintage is certainly showing signs of rich maturity. It has developed the undergrowth aromas and spice flavors of ready-to-drink Pinot Noir. It has also retained plenty of acidity. It is a lightly tannic wine that is ready to drink.
France,Burgundy,Domaine de Bellene 2014 Les Quartiers de Nuits  (Vosne-Romanée),Pinot Noir,93,115.0,"There is plenty of the power and structure of a Vosne-Romanée in this single parcel wine. It has density and concentration over a rich full black-fruit character. There are still signs of the wood aging and some high toast flavors that need to integrate, so wait until 2020."
France,Burgundy,Domaine des Varoilles 2010 Clos du Meix des Ouches  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,90,130.0,"A single-vineyard wine, this is firmly structured and full of perfumed fruit.

France,Loire Valley,Château la Varière 2009 La Grande Chevalerie Cabernet Sauvignon (Anjou Villages Brissac),Cabernet Sauvignon,91,45.0,"It is rare to find pure Cabernet Sauvignon in the Loire, but 2009 was the year when it worked with ripe black currant and berry fruits.

France,Provence,Château Revelette 2005 Red (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence),Red Blend,87,16.0,"A blend of Syrah, Grenache and Cabernet Sauvignon, this unwooded red features warm, spicy aromas and flavors of dark fruit, cinnamon, clove and hints of black pepper. Dry and savory on the finish."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Jeannin-Naltet 2015 Vieilles Vignes  (Mercurey),Pinot Noir,88,30.0,"Old vines lend a fine structure and density to this wine. It's not for longterm aging, with its ripe red plum fruit and generous texture, but is delicious now. Drink from early 2018."
France,Champagne,Thiénot 2007 Cuvée Garance Blanc de Rouges Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,92,100.0,"Named after the daughter of owner Alain Thiénot, this Champagne comes from the Montagne de Reims.

France,Burgundy,Bailly-Lapierre NV Brut  (Crémant de Bourgogne),Pinot Noir,90,24.0,"This is deliciously fragrant, with harmonious fruit and acidity. It has a full, rich character that offers currant and citrus flavors."
France,Burgundy,Chanson Père et Fils 2009 Dominode Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,90,42.0,"This shows Savigny's softness and approachability, along with tannins and acids. It is firmly concentrated, creating a wine that feels complete, juicy and rich."
France,Burgundy,Chanson Père et Fils 2009  Volnay,Pinot Noir,90,52.0,"This is a firm wine with great fruit density, with a round, generous and velvety texture. It has a touch of wood that needs to integrate with the flavor of red plum skin. The dark tannins create a wine that will age for several years."
France,Burgundy,Château Philippe-le-Hardi 2009 Les Brunettes et Planchots  (Aloxe-Corton),Pinot Noir,90,43.0,"With its ripe strawberry-jam flavor, this demonstrates classic Pinot Noir juiciness. It has dry tannins as well, yielding a ripe, concentrated wine that needs five years of aging."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Faiveley 2010 Clos des Myglands Premier Cru  (Mercurey),Pinot Noir,90,40.0,"Clos des Myglands is a vineyard wholly owned by Faiveley. In 2010, it has produced a richly structured wine, full of ripe plum and sweet acidity that dominates the firm tannins. The finish is juicy, balanced by a jammy character."

A structured effort that's meant to age for five years and more."
France,France Other,Frédéric Lornet 2011 Pinot Noir (Arbois),Pinot Noir,84,28.0,"High acidity gives this wine freshness, while the fruitiness is somewhat more distant. It could age, but the bitter edge and the acidity are difficult to get past."
France,Burgundy,Jaffelin 2009  Nuits-St.-Georges,Pinot Noir,87,55.0,"This wine is solid, concentrated and tannic, and it has a dark chocolate flavor from having aged in wood. It's likely to develop into a chunky wine over the next few years."
France,Burgundy,Jaffelin 2010  Chambolle-Musigny,Pinot Noir,87,32.0,"This is a lightweight Chambolle that's dominated by red fruit and acidity. There is a bitter edge that comes from the wood and the firm structure of the vintage. However, with its attractive, juicy finish, it is already soft enough to drink."
France,Burgundy,Moillard 2010 Clos du Meix Trouhans  (Fixin),Pinot Noir,87,42.0,"A firmly structured wine, this has a dry character that's underscored by red fruit and balancing acidity. It needs to age for a few years to be at its best."
France,Loire Valley,Chavet Fils 2013 Cuvée Exception  (Menetou-Salon),Pinot Noir,87,24.0,"This ripe, wood-aged wine has fragrant red-cherry flavors and good acidity.

France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Château d'Antugnac 2005 Aux Bons Hommes Red (Limoux),Red Blend,90,13.0,"A big, smooth, ripe wine, with rich raspberry-jam flavors and just gently dry tannins. This blend of Merlot with some Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon comes from vineyards 1,500 feet in the Limoux hills, yet it has the richness of a wine from warmer climate. Wood and spices add interest and richness."
France,Southwest France,L'Enclos des Braves 2016 Tombé du Ciel Red (Gaillac),Red Blend,87,18.0,"Fallen from the sky is the name of this wine, alongside a child's drawing of a spaceship. The wine itself is more earthbound, soft and with forward ripe fruitiness. Red berries and plums are right up there alongside plenty of acidity. Drink this easy wine now."
France,Loire Valley,Barton & Guestier 2011  Rosé d'Anjou,Red Blend,84,10.0,"Light, fruity and sweet, this is classic Rosé d'Anjou. Bright strawberry fruits are softly linked with a crisp texture and acidity to finish."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Jessiaume 2006 Gravières Premier Cru  (Santenay),Pinot Noir,87,,"Softly rich, a rounded wine that brings out ripe plums and sweet strawberry jam. The acidity only kicks in towards the end, as the tannins and final rich character offer contrast."

France,Burgundy,Joseph Faiveley 2010  Gevrey-Chambertin,Pinot Noir,90,70.0,"Light colored and fruity, this is all about red fruit—its structure and firm tannins coming out slowly.

France,Burgundy,Olivier Leflaive 2010  Pommard,Pinot Noir,90,80.0,"Tannins and severe fruit flavors are the initial impressions of this wine. Behind the mineral, austere exterior, there is a richer, fatter core—its ripe red fruits waiting to surface. Keep for at least three years."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Perrot-Minot 2010  Charmes-Chambertin,Pinot Noir,95,,"This is big, muscular and very opulent, with its density lying over its minerality. Flavors of black stone fruits and red berries have the intensity of a powerful, age-worthy wine."
France,Burgundy,Chanson Père et Fils 2009  Clos de Vougeot,Pinot Noir,94,187.0,"This is a ripe Pinot Noir, with a firm and solid structure and a very dense character.

France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Le Grand Noir 2010 Pinot Noir (Pays d'Oc),Pinot Noir,85,10.0,"A soft earthy character adds depth to the strawberry and rhubarb fruit aromas and flavors. The palate is clean and bright, with a cocoa-dusted red-berry fruit finish."
France,Alsace,Domaine Zinck NV Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Crémant d'Alsace),Pinot Noir,85,25.0,"A pale rosé in color, this light and fruity wine has a fresh raspberry flavor, with a zingy texture that gives attractive acidity. It's light and creamy, hinting at yeastiness on the finish."
France,Burgundy,Louis Latour 2011 Vignes Franches Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,91,75.0,"Fruity and ripe, it also presents a fresh feel that cuts through the jammy red fruits and gives an edge to the weight and velvet texture. It's almost ready to drink but will be better from 2015."
France,Burgundy,Domaine René Bouvier 2011  Fixin,Pinot Noir,91,,"The big tannins indicate a wine with powerful potential. It has weight, richness, generous red fruits and a strong sense of structure. The freshness of the vintage comes through in the acidity at the end. Drink from 2018."

France,Burgundy,Domaines Devillard 2010 Domaine des Perdrix  (Bourgogne),Pinot Noir,87,37.0,"Very pure, this has a clean strawberry flavor, with exhilarating acidity. The wine has some structure and firm tannins, although its fruitiness is the dominant factor."
France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot 2006 Domaine du Clos Frantin Les Murots  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,89,,"A solid, dense wine, its rich tannins dominating dark black fruits. The wine is ponderous, brooding, with shafts of acidity giving it a lift. But it does need a couple of years to soften that core of serious tannins."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Jayer-Gilles 2006  Côte de Nuits-Villages,Pinot Noir,89,79.0,"A rounded, mouthfilling wine. At the beginning, it seems very soft, but then it is possible to discern rich tannins through the concentrated red fruits and black plums. The acidity is there all the time, a fine counterpoint to the seductive, rich fruits and dry tannins."
France,Burgundy,Bouchard Père & Fils 2006 Clos de la Mousse Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,89,55.0,"An intriguing wine, that offers ripe sweetness followed by an edgy rustic acidity. Is this a stage in its evolution? Probably, because the tannins promise aging and the intensely aromatic nature of the fruit points to a potentially fine wine. Just don't drink it yet."
France,Burgundy,Louis Max 2014 Aux Fourneaux Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,91,18.0,"Opulent and ripe, this wine has fine tannins that support the rich red fruit and smoky acidity.

It is light, strawberry-juice flavored, with green acidity. Ready to drink now."
France,Alsace,Wolfberger NV Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,89,22.0,The pure scent of freshly picked strawberries is as enticing on the nose as it is on the palate. The gentle flavors are supported by bright lemony freshness and a frothy fizzy mousse that accentuates the purity of these primary flavors perfectly. All of this spells lightness and ease. The finish is dry and full of strawberry notes.
France,Alsace,Jean-Baptiste Adam NV Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Crémant d'Alsace),Pinot Noir,89,25.0,"The scent of very fragrant ripe apples abounds on the nose: think both Red and Golden Delicious.

France,Champagne,Mailly Grand Cru NV Blanc de Noirs Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,91,,"A full-bodied wine made from Pinot Noir, this has richness and weight, accentuated by green-plum and lime flavors, but also an intense acidity.

Lean and slightly tart on the palate, it has a taut structure and a clean but short finish. Drink now."
France,Southwest France,Château Bellevue la Forêt 2010 Red (Fronton),Red Blend,86,15.0,"Négrette gives its typical earthy character to this spicy, fruity wine. It's full in the mouth, aromatic with black fruits bolstered by a light tannic edge. Drink now."
France,Burgundy,Maison Stéphane Brocard 2015 Closerie des Alisiers  (Bourgogne),Pinot Noir,87,20.0,"This is a fruity, juicy and soft wine.

Drink from 2017."
France,Loire Valley,Fournier Père et Fils 2012 Les Belles Vignes  (Sancerre),Pinot Noir,87,27.0,"This attractive, smoky wine has a soft, juicy texture that comes through the red fruits. Balanced and ripe, it finishes with acidity and is ready to drink."
France,Southwest France,Château de Rhodes 2011 Red (Gaillac),Red Blend,89,17.0,"This is a juicy wine, stuffed with soft berry fruits and jammy black currant flavors. It has some tannins, lightly integrated into the general fruitiness of this wine. With Dural and Braucol in dominance, it holds a touch of dryness at the center that will allow it age. Drink from 2016."
France,Loire Valley,Château de Sancerre 2012  Sancerre,Pinot Noir,87,,"This is a soft, fruity wine that is already mature. It still has berry and red plum fruitiness although this is now integrated with the gentle tannic structure.

France,Southwest France,Domaine de Gensac 2011 Piaffer Red (Gers),Red Blend,87,27.0,"This is a dark and tannic wine, very firm and dense. It has weight while also allowing room for acidity.

A hint of vanilla-strawberry sweetens up the close. Drink now."
France,Southwest France,Castel Montplaisir 1997 Red (Cahors),Red Blend,84,11.0,"Another Cahors from the stable of Alain-Dominque Perrin, this one is the entry-level wine, made to be more accessible than his flagship wine from Château Lagrezette or the luxury cuvée.

France,Burgundy,Domaine Pierre Guillemot 2014 Aux Gravains Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,85,50.0,"This wine is structured with red fruits. It has a thin texture, a metallic character that is less pleasant. It needs more weight and richness."
France,Burgundy,Château de Santenay 2012 Vieille Vignes  (Bourgogne),Pinot Noir,87,25.0,"This wine is dry and smoky, with tannins that will allow it to age. The fruit, though, only hints at red berry fruits and should be more developed for a simple appellation wine such as this. Drink from 2017."

France,Burgundy,Domaine Maillard 2013  Chorey-lès-Beaune,Pinot Noir,87,37.0,"Chorey vineyards, on the plain close to Beaune, often produce good-value wines. This attractive wine is a good example from an uneven vintage. It has structure and fruit, maybe not enough, along with a fresh, tangy character. It is developing fast, so drink from 2017."
France,Burgundy,Domaines Devillard 2015 Domaine de la Ferté  (Givry),Pinot Noir,87,35.0,"Wood aromas and spice show strongly in this wine. On the palate, there is a toasty character that gives a bitter edge to the ripe red fruits. That needs to go, so wait to drink this wine from 2019."

France,Loire Valley,Domaine Roger Champault 2014 Les Pierris  (Sancerre),Pinot Noir,87,21.0,"With its origins in the 17th century, this estate has 50 acres.

France,Alsace,Domaine Marcel Deiss 2013 Rouge Red (Alsace),Red Blend,91,27.0,"This is not an obvious wine, but one that creeps up slowly, takes time and impresses quietly.

France,Burgundy,Vignerons de Mancey 2013 Cuvée Agnès de Couëdic  (Mercurey),Pinot Noir,87,25.0,"Already this wine is so smooth that it is quite ready to drink.

France,Alsace,Vignoble des 2 Lunes 2012 Poussière d'Étoiles Pinot Noir (Crémant d'Alsace),Pinot Noir,89,28.0,"Very soft, faint strawberry nose hints at freshness and summery fruit.

This is very elegant and understated but all the more touching for that. The finish is totally refreshing and dry."
France,Burgundy,Domaines Devillard 2011 Domaine des Perdrix Aux Perdrix Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,93,105.0,"A dense wine, rich and smooth for a Nuits-St-Georges, full of ripe red fruits, dark cherries and acidity that almost gives the wine a fresh character. Behind this fruitiness is a more solid, dark structure of tannins that will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2018."
France,Loire Valley,Domaine Franck Millet 2014 Sur le Chêne  (Sancerre),Pinot Noir,91,25.0,"Partly barrel-fermented, this impressively ripe wine has structure and tannins, as well as attractive, perfumed fruits. The tannins add spice as well as a touch of pepper while integrating well with the lively, fresh fruits at the end. Drink from 2018."
France,Alsace,Pierre and Charles Sparr NV Rosé Cuvée Renaissance Brut Pinot Noir (Crémant d'Alsace),Pinot Noir,83,,"A lively wine that has flavors of toast as well as red fruits. It is not completely dry, with a soft, sweet aftertaste that has masked the acidity."
France,Burgundy,Louis Latour 2014 Les Chaillots Premier Cru  (Aloxe-Corton),Pinot Noir,91,90.0,"This wine is firm and structured, with dark tannins and a dense texture that is still dry. It offers ripe fruit as well as acidity, currently overshadowed by the tannins but will come to the fore with some time. The wine will age well, thanks to the solid structure and dry core of tannins. Drink from 2020."
France,Burgundy,Albert Morot 2014 Bataillière Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,91,60.0,"This wine is big and ripe with layers of tannins and attractive fruitiness. Bright acidity comes from the strawberry and red-cherry fruit. The drier structure is integrating well, with plenty of richness behind. The wine will develop well; drink from 2019."
France,France Other,Barton & Guestier 2009 Bistro Pinot Noir (Vin de Pays de l'Ile de Beauté),Pinot Noir,83,8.0,"Unoaked Pinot Noir from Corsica, showing ripe berry flavors, fresh acidity and only light tannins. It's what it says on the label: for casual drinking."
France,Alsace,Allimant-Laugner 2015 Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,90,17.0,"An aromatic hint of pine mixes with the red cherry notes on the nose, creating a very appetizing opening. The ultralight palate is translucent and slender, with the same leafy conifer aromas and lots and lots of red currant brightness and freshness. The light crunchy nature of this wine suggests that this is ideal for chilling. It's a weightless, very aromatic, and ultra-light-bodied red."
France,Alsace,Robert Klingenfus 2012 Orfèvre en Arôme Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,84,,"Still young and with strong wood aging flavors, this is otherwise a light wine where the fruit is reticent. Bitter cherry flavors show through along with acidity, and the wine obviously needs time to settle down. Drink from 2016."
France,Alsace,Domaine Pfister 2012 Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,84,29.0,"An attractively soft and fruity wine, flavored with red cherries and given a lift with acidity. It's a simple, lightly structured wine that can be drunk now."
France,Burgundy,Château Philippe-le-Hardi 2010 Clos du Roi Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,86,,"This is lightly structured, showing balanced red berry fruits and round tannins. For a 2010, it is softening fast; this should be drinkable in the next six months."
France,Burgundy,Château Philippe-le-Hardi 2010 La Brigadière Vieilles Vignes  (Mercurey),Pinot Noir,86,24.0,"Soft and crisp, this is light in texture and very fragrant. It boasts intense strawberry flavors, with already well-integrated tannins and a smooth, easy finish."
France,Alsace,René Muré 2012 Cuvée V Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,88,50.0,"This soft and ripe wine is full of bright cherry flavors, with gentle tannins and just a hint of wood aging. A proper Pinot Noir acidity brings out the fruitiness of the wine. Drink now."
France,Burgundy,François Bertheau 2011 Les Amoureuses  (Chambolle-Musigny),Pinot Noir,94,,"This wine has great fruitiness, soft tannins and generous, ripe red fruits, while finishing dry. It's a wine with the structure for aging while also packed with big red fruits. Keep for 4–6 years."
France,Burgundy,Domaine des Croix 2011 Bressandes Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,94,68.0,"A fine, mineral, structured wine with a very dry, solid core. Juicy red fruits offer a hint for its future ripeness. It has the freshness of the vintage that shows through at the end of this chunky wine. Age for 5–7 years."
France,Burgundy,Labouré-Roi 2009 Le Taillefer  (Pommard),Pinot Noir,88,,"The wine has firm, dark tannins as befits a Pommard, with underlying sumptuous black fruit. As the tannins soften, this will become a rich and juicy wine, and it will likely always remain structured."
France,Burgundy,Simonnet-Febvre 2014  Irancy,Red Blend,87,21.0,This blend of Pinot Noir and the rare local César grape is as light as red wine can get in Burgundy. This northern region close to Chablis produces bright fruity expressions that attractively balance red cherry flavor with racy acidity. Drink now.
France,France Other,Yves Leccia 2014 YL Rouge Red (Ile de Beauté),Red Blend,89,28.0,"This blend of Grenache and Niellucciu comes from vines that are up to 40 years old. It is a big, bold ripe and juicy wine, bursting with black plum and berry flavors. The wine is fruity enough to drink now, although it should age for at least 10 years."
France,Southwest France,Domaine Rotier 2013 Les Gravels Red (Gaillac),Red Blend,90,40.0,"This wine has an intense structure while not losing sight of fruit. It's a solid wine with dominant tannins. It also has intense acidity and, in the background, red berry fruits. It needs time to come together into an impressive wine. Drink from 2017."
France,Burgundy,Louis Latour 2012  Beaune,Pinot Noir,87,45.0,"This is soft and rounded, with attractive red plum and berry fruits that bring in acidity and a light tannic character. The wine is ripe, with a dry core surrounded by cherry flavors and fresh acidity. It is not a wine for long aging, drink from 2017."
France,Southwest France,Château Laurou 2013 Les Complices Red (Fronton),Red Blend,89,18.0,"Half-and-half Négrette and Syrah, this is typical blend for Fronton with its hints of the Mediterranean mixed in with a more Atlantic influence. The wine is soft and balanced with dusty tannins, red fruits and a perfumed aftertaste. Drink now."
France,Alsace,Rieflé 2011 Côte de Rouffach Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,90,30.0,"The weight of the bottle seems to foretell this wine's weight, structure and judiciously layered oak influence. With ripe cherry and berry flavors, it's a wine that can age. Drink from 2015."
France,Alsace,Joseph Cattin 2010 Steinbach Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,90,35.0,"Steinbach is a village at the extreme southern end of the Alsace vineyard, known for its Pinot Noir. This is a rich, full example—a wine that has structure and concentration, as well as ripe cherry fruitiness. It can be drunk now, or until 2022."
France,Provence,Mas de la Dame 2011 Cuvée Gourmande Red (Les Baux de Provence),Red Blend,90,16.0,"Solid and firmly tannic, this is a wine with forward red-fruit flavors, a dry core and dense texture. The structure of this balanced wine along with its concentration promise aging. Drink from 2016."
France,Champagne,Mailly Grand Cru NV Blanc de Pinot Noir Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,92,52.0,"As part of a range of wines that are based on specific parcels of vines, this wine has also been partially wood fermented. Its richness and the touches of spice and toastiness give the wine a ripe rounded character. However, it is dry, crisply textured with a touch of tannin to give it structure. Drink now."
France,Burgundy,Dujac Fils & Pere 2014  Gevrey-Chambertin,Pinot Noir,92,80.0,"A fine blend of ripe fruit and crisp red berry flavors, this negociant wine produced by Domaine Dujac is structured and generous. The bright acidity reflects the vintage while the structure and tannins reflect the appellation. Together, they will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2019."
France,Burgundy,Louis Latour 2010 En Chevret Premier Cru  (Volnay),Pinot Noir,89,65.0,"Rich, round and concentrated, this is developing fast. The acidity is already comfortably embedded in the ripe red-berry fruit.."
France,Burgundy,Chanson Père et Fils 2009  Gevrey-Chambertin,Pinot Noir,89,72.0,"Concentrated and complex, this has structure and acidity, with a black cherry flavor. It's a ripe, powerful wine that could become more generous as it ages."

France,Burgundy,Domaine A. Machard de Gramont 2010 Les Damodes Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,89,78.0,"For a Premier Cru, this is surprisingly open and ready. It has a light structure, offering delicious, forward, juicy fruit that has been rounded out by wood aging. With its ripe character, it will be ready to drink in a year."
France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2013 Pinot Noir (Pays d'Oc),Pinot Noir,84,16.0,The wine is so soft that only the light wood flavors give it shape. It is smooth with red plum fruits that are rounded and sweet in style. Acidity seems to be an afterthought. Drink now.
France,Languedoc-Roussillon,French Rabbit 2007 Pinot Noir (Vin de Pays d'Oc),Pinot Noir,83,5.0,"Smells a little warm with notes of stewed red berries and brandied cherries. Lightweight with medium acidity and virtually no tannins—this is an easy-to-drink option; given the Tetra-pak packaging, a great choice for concerts, camping and picnics."
France,Southwest France,Château Bouissel 2010 Classic Red (Fronton),Red Blend,88,14.0,"Made using fruit sourced from vineyards on the highest terrace above the Tarn River, this fruity wine is made to be consumed young. It has a touch of minerality and some firm tannins, but the red berry fruit and flower note is already attractive. A blend of Négrette, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec."
France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Château Cabezac 2006 Cariñu Red (Vin de Pays du Val de Cesse),Red Blend,87,15.0,"Starts off a touch funky, but that subsides after a couple of minutes in the glass. Black plum and cassis are strong on the nose and mouth, backed by accents of vanilla, black pepper spice and roasted coffee granules. The finish is long and evolving, moving from black fruit flavors to cherry pits and ending on sweet oak flavors."
France,Southwest France,L'Enclos des Braves 2013 Les Gourmands Red (Gaillac),Red Blend,87,16.0,"Dominated by the local Duras grape, this spicy and fruity wine has an intriguing blend of juicy acidity and leathery tannins. It gives a wine that could benefit from aging while also being ready to drink now. Give it the benefit of the doubt and wait until 2016."
France,Burgundy,Louis Jadot 2011 Clos du Roy  (Marsannay),Pinot Noir,90,36.0,"Dense tannins dominate this firm and structured wine. Behind the dry surface lies fruitiness, bringing out red currant and berry flavors along  with acidity. The wine is potentially rich and deliciously perfumed. Drink from 2017."
France,Champagne,Jean Laurent NV Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,86,56.0,"This soft wine has strong red-berry flavors and a ripe, lightly tannic texture from the 100% Pinot Noir. It is fruity and ready to drink."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Jessiaume 2015  Auxey-Duresses,Pinot Noir,88,30.0,"Behind the main vineyards of the Côte de Beaune, this village makes some delicious wines, both red and white. This village wine, full of fruit, also has wood-aging flavors and firm spicy tannins. It is coming together well and will be ready to drink from 2020."
France,Burgundy,Domaines Devillard 2015 Domaine des Perdrix  (Bourgogne),Pinot Noir,88,35.0,"The Domaine des Perdrix is based at Nuits Saint-Georges, so this wine comes from the Côte de Nuits. It is richly fruity with layers of warm red fruits and soft tannins. Rounded and ripe, the wine is an instant success. Drink now."
France,Burgundy,Capitain-Gagnerot 2011 Les Grandes Lolières  (Corton),Pinot Noir,94,99.0,"From right at the northern end of the sweep of Corton Grand Cru vineyards, this rich and complex wine is dense with smoky flavors as well as ripe blackberry fruit. It is solid, densely structured and powered minerality from the chalk in the soil. This is going to be a fine wine, so drink from 2019."
France,Burgundy,Domaines Devillard 2014 Château de Chamirey Les Cinq  (Mercurey),Pinot Noir,94,95.0,"This is a blend of the best barrels from the five Mercurey Premier Crus owned by the Devillard family. First produced in the 2010 vintage, the wine is now made in most vintages. It is a rich wine, bringing out the pure red fruitiness of a Mercurey and its beautifully integrated structure. It is concentrated and very dense, packed with vanilla, mint and dark coffee flavors as well as the fruit. Age this wine, at least until 2020."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Faiveley 2015 Clos de l'Ecu Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,89,77.0,Perfumed spice aromas give this wine its toasty character. The wood aging dominates the fruit. The fruit is ripe and will develop. Give this wine until 2024.
France,Burgundy,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2015 Vieilles Vignes  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,89,47.0,Old vines on the Aegerter Domaine in Savigny-lès-Beaune give a rounded ripe wine. It has a crisper red-cherry side to its otherwise smooth texture. The tannins support all this juicy fruit and offer a chance for the wine to age. Drink from 2020.
France,Burgundy,L. Tramier & Fils 2015 Collection Tramier  (Corton),Pinot Noir,89,140.0,This still-young wine is jammy while firmly structured with dry tannins. There is a foursquare character that misses subtlety with its broad-brush approach. The wine does need to age and will be ready to drink from 2023.
France,Provence,Domaine de la Sauveuse 2006 Cuvée Philippine Red (Côtes de Provence),Red Blend,90,19.0,"Like the estate's Cuvée Carolle, this has a note of volatility and sur-maturité, but it's also bigger, richer and more extracted, with lots of ripe tannins but also thick purple fruit that comes through on the finish. Try in 2010. 40% Syrah, 40% Cab Sauvignon, 10% Mourvèdre, 10% Grenache."
France,Loire Valley,Isabelle et Pierre Clément 2015 Tradition  (Menetou-Salon),Pinot Noir,88,25.0,"While there is a youthful stalky element to this wine, it also has plenty of ripe black-cherry fruit. That suggests a warm ripe future as the tannins soften. Drink this potentially rich, spicy wine from 2019."
France,Champagne,Lamiable 2005 Les Meslaines Grand Cru Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,92,67.0,"Les Meslaines is the name of the parcel of Pinot Noir that produces this Blanc de Noirs. It has richness, a ripe character with fresh apricot flavors, a Champagne that has the weight of a wine. It could do with bottle age, but for freshness drink now."
France,Champagne,Soutiran NV Perle Noire Brut Grand Cru Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,92,69.0,"A Blanc de Noirs made from 100% Pinot Noir, this is already showing some maturity, with flavors of black truffles and mushrooms to go with the richness. There is a yeasty character that blends well with the almonds and currants. The finish is ripe and full."
France,Alsace,Henri Schoenheitz 2011 Cuvée Saint Grégoire Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,86,25.0,"Spicy and fruity, this is a lightweight, attractive and smooth wine. It has some undergrowth aromas, followed by red berry fruits, with fresh acidity at the end. Drink now."
France,Burgundy,Domaine René Bouvier 2011 Crais de Chêne  (Fixin),Pinot Noir,89,,"From the good-value Fixin appellation, this full wine offers minerality but, more noticeably, a ripe, red-fruited feel, with acidity to give freshness. Hints of licorice show the wood aging. Drink from 2016."
France,Burgundy,Maison Ambroise 2011  Côte de Nuits-Villages,Pinot Noir,89,39.0,"Rounded and ripe, it has tannins nicely embedded in the red plum and strawberry flavors. It's full-bodied and already showing a delicious, seductive side. Drink from 2016."
France,Burgundy,Manuel Olivier 2009 Vieilles Vignes  (Hautes Côtes de Nuits),Pinot Noir,86,24.0,"With the extra concentration from the low-yielding old vines, this is a dense wine, with its acidity contrasting the rich red fruit. It is round and smooth, with well-integrated tannins and a soft, fruity finish."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Coquard Loison-Fleurot 2010  Vosne-Romanée,Pinot Noir,86,63.0,"Firm and structured, this has strong tannins set over smoky fruit. It has concentration, although the wood flavor has an old-wood feel, seeming just a touch dirty."
France,Burgundy,Nuiton-Beaunoy 2010  Hautes Côtes de Nuits,Pinot Noir,86,16.0,"Light, fragrant, and structured, this shows a smoky flavor and refreshing red-berry fruit. It's lively and fruity, and the tannins are in the background."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Jessiaume 2008  Bourgogne,Pinot Noir,84,20.0,"An easy, fruity wine, its attractive red cherry flavors bubbling away in soft tannins and light acidity. Very drinkable, and not for aging."
France,Languedoc-Roussillon,Les Vignerons de la Méditerranée 2009 Réserve St. Martin Cabernet Sauvignon (Vin de Pays d'Oc),Cabernet Sauvignon,84,10.0,"Here's a simple but enjoyable Cab with notes of black plum, violet and cassis. Medium weight with soft tannins and a solid finish."
France,Southwest France,Domaine du Moulin 2010 Le Faucon Red (Côtes du Tarn),Red Blend,90,30.0,"A blend of Braucol and Tannat, this a dark-colored blockbuster, with firm tannins that are mitigated by the smooth, rich blackberry flavor. It has power, immense concentration and great density. Age for 3–4 years."
France,Southwest France,Domaine Chiroulet 2015 Java by Chiroulet Red (Côtes de Gascogne),Red Blend,84,9.0,"The wine is full of stalky black currant fruits and fresh acidity. A blend of Bordeaux-style grapes with Syrah, it is made to be drunk young and slightly chilled for the summer. Drink now."
France,Southwest France,Vinovalie 2014 Tarani Cabernet Sauvignon,Cabernet Sauvignon,83,,"This is a stalky wine, with black currant fruits and a soft texture. It is full of acidity and light fruitiness that will make it attractive if drunk lightly chilled. Drink now."
France,Alsace,Pierre Sparr 2003 Presitge Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,88,26.0,"Developed aromas of forest floor and mushrooms come as no surprise, given the deep brick color on this Alsace Pinot. The highly nuanced palate is complex and shot through with mineral notes. Cherry cola flavors dominate the long finish. An excellent foil for squab or other game birds."
France,Provence,Domaine Houchart 2013 Red (Côtes de Provence),Red Blend,88,14.0,"There is a definite touch of stalkiness here, perhaps a consequence of the vintage. It has black currant fruits and balanced acidity, needing a few more months to be developed. Drink from 2016."
France,France Other,Kiwi Cuvée 2014 Bin 518 Pinot Noir (Vin de France),Pinot Noir,85,10.0,"The nose of this wine is all fruit—strawberry, raspberry and cherry abound. Flavor wise, the accessible palate offers more of the same, with light tannins and ample acidity to keep the mouthfeel fresh and the finish clean."
France,France Other,Belles Vignes 2014 Grenache-Syrah-Marselan Red (Vin de France),Red Blend,85,10.0,"Scents of violet, brambly berry and blackcurrant leaf lead the bouquet of this earthy blend, with a light gamy character in the background.

France,Burgundy,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2012 Vieilles Vignes  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,88,52.0,"This firm wine still needs to shed its youthful structure of tannin and bring out the underlying ripe fruits. It has weight, hints of juicy acidity and a medium-term potential. The end shows some of the natural concentration from old vines."
France,Burgundy,Louis Latour 2010 Château Corton Grancey  (Corton),Pinot Noir,93,130.0,"A firm, powerful wine, its tannins still very dominant. Acidity is a factor, along with deep red-plum fruit. Some sweetness will develop in the next several years, although this concentrated and complex wine will also have a solid core of dry, structured tannin. Age for at least five years."
France,Burgundy,Olivier Leflaive 2010 Epenots Premier Cru  (Pommard),Pinot Noir,93,100.0,"This is complex and powerful, with its energy directed equally at the concentrated tannins and at the ripe damson and plum fruits. It's going to be a delicious wine—the wood element smoothing the firm edge. Age for at least five years."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Perrot-Minot 2010 Les Beaux-Monts Premier Cru  (Vosne-Romanée),Pinot Noir,93,,"A minerally textured wine, this layers tannins and a dark, brooding character over the ripe black fruits. It has considerable power and richness, with intensity of fruit and spice, and a sweet, almost soft finish."
France,Burgundy,Chanson Père et Fils 2009 Clos des Fèves Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,93,107.0,"This is dark and wood laden, with sweet, rich fruit and a firm, dense structure. It has a full feel, and its opulence is likely to develop over the next 2–3 years."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Drouhin-Laroze 2010 Lavaut Saint-Jacques Premier Cru  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,93,,"Structured, dense and packed with black fruits, this is complex wine. Yet with all of its ripeness, it offers a great line of freshness and a smoky wood flavor, with blackberry-like acidity on the finish. Age for five years or more."
France,Alsace,Cave de Cleebourg NV Clérotstein Rosé Brut Pinot Noir (Crémant d'Alsace),Pinot Noir,86,19.0,"Very creamy mousse leads to a tight wine with raspberry flavors and considerable acidity. That makes the wine very fresh, crisp, clean with an attractive final fragrance. It's ready to drink but could have a few months' bottle age."
France,Champagne,Lelarge-Pugeot NV Premier Cru Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,88,49.0,"Fresh, ripe and fruity, this is a rich wine, produced from vines to the west of Reims. It has perfumed wild strawberry flavors and acidity. Attractively crisp at the end, it's a ready-to-drink wine that will be just right as an apéritif."
France,Burgundy,Derey Frères 2012 Vieilles Vignes  (Fixin),Pinot Noir,85,32.0,"Light tannins accompany crisp red fruits. What it lacks in weight and complexity, it makes up for with a smooth texture, good acidity and a structure that will allow it age for another year."
France,Burgundy,L. Tramier & Fils 2012 La Minée  (Bourgogne),Pinot Noir,85,,"While the aromas have rustic overtones, the wine itself goes down the red fruit path. It shows juicy cherry flavors, soft but present tannins and a good touch of spice and wood. There is an attractive smoky aftertaste. Drink in 2015."
France,Alsace,Vieil Armand 2009 Château Ollwiller Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,87,15.0,"Light in color, this is a soft, red fruited wine. It has red cherry flavors with a dry edge of fruit tannin and wood. The acidity and the juicy aftertaste give a really attractive finish."
France,Burgundy,Roche de Bellene 2014 Vieilles Vignes  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,92,65.0,"From a two-acre parcel of vines planted in 1950, this is a finely perfumed, rich wine. It has generous red fruits and an equally opulent ripe character. The tannins are there—a dry layer that is supporting the spice—as is a firm solid texture. Drink this wine (which is still developing) from 2019."
France,Burgundy,Roche de Bellene 2014 Vieilles Vignes  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,92,64.0,"Negociant Nicolas Potel has made a specialty of sourcing old vines. In this wine, they are between 44 and 54-years-old. The wine is rich and concentrated—dark with tannins and generous with black fruits. It is firm and obviously needs to age. Drink this sold wine from 2020."
France,Burgundy,Roche de Bellene 2014 Vieilles Vignes  (Volnay),Pinot Noir,92,63.0,"Vines planted in 1934 are behind this smooth and concentrated wine.

France,Burgundy,Labouré-Roi 2008 La Futaille  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,91,42.0,"A heavily oaked wine that needs time for the toast to integrate. It does have the black fruit structure to back it up, so expect this complex wine to develop pleasurably over the next 5–6 years."
France,Burgundy,Pierre André 2007 Santenots  (Volnay),Pinot Noir,91,68.0,"Ripe, sweet-fruited wine, its red berry fruits and opulent tannins giving a rounded feel. There is, as well, a good structure composed of acidity, licorice and wood. It needs 2–3 years still to really develop all its depth of flavor."
France,Alsace,Domaine Charles Frey 2016 Harmonie Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,89,,"A lick of vanilla precedes red berries on the nose. On the palate, the berries are expressed as red currant and lovely tart cranberry. This is fresh and light, easy and totally fruit-driven. It would work well as a chilled red with its refreshing backbone and light body."
France,Burgundy,Château de la Crée 2008 Clos du Château  (Santenay),Pinot Noir,89,,Richly textured wine that oozes jammy red fruits and ripe tannins. It has a good dry core followed by sweet acidity and a juicy berry character. The wine has some power and aging potential.
France,Burgundy,Vignerons de Mancey 2014  Bourgogne,Pinot Noir,84,15.0,"Red fruits dominate this wine with its soft tannins and wild strawberry flavors. It is young, although with its gentle texture it is ready to drink now. The wine comes from the northern part of the Mâcon region."
France,Burgundy,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2013 Belle Canaille  (Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Nuits),Pinot Noir,84,28.0,"The Hautes Côtes need a good vintage to shine. The 2013 was not one of those vintages and this lean wine shows its structure more than its fruit. It gives a dry, tannic character that is unlikely to soften greatly. It could be worth waiting and drinking from 2017."
France,Loire Valley,Daniel Chotard 2015  Sancerre,Pinot Noir,91,30.0,"Wood aged and ripe, this is a structured wine that is full of fruit and still young. It has bright cherry flavors that have been softened and smoothed out by the wood aging. There is also a mineral edge to the fruitiness. It will be a rich wine but it needs more time. Drink from 2019."
France,Alsace,Rieflé 2010 Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,87,,"This is a wine with good depth of flavor. The toast and wood characters are already balancing well with the soft, juicy fruit and acidity. It will age for 2–3 years and round out."
France,Alsace,Clément Klur 2015 Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,91,25.0,"Pure notes of black cherry rise from the glass. The palate comes in with equal purity and quite some concentration. There is a creamy richness countering that fresh crunchy cherry fruit which shimmers and shines. This is medium bodied, bone dry but juicy and wonderfully aromatic, even elegant."
France,Southwest France,Château Clément Termes 2014 Mémoire Red (Gaillac),Red Blend,90,30.0,"The top wine from this estate is a blend of Syrah and Braucol. It is still firm and tannic, rich with perfumed black fruits. Made from the property's oldest vines and wood aged, it has hints of licorice as well as a toasty edge.

France,Burgundy,Domaine Laleure-Piot 2015 Clos de Bully  (Pernand-Vergelesses),Pinot Noir,90,,"This estate, now owned by the negociant Champy, specializes in the vineyards around Pernand-Vergelesses.

Drink from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Labouré-Roi 2015 Clos Rousseau Premier Cru  (Santenay),Pinot Noir,90,40.0,"From the village at the southern end of the Côte de Beaune, this wine is warm and ripe, with great berry flavors and a good sense of structure from tannins and wood aging. It's packed with fruit and likely to age well. Drink from 2021."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Jessiaume 2008 Clos Genet  (Santenay),Pinot Noir,88,35.0,"Rounded and soft, very approachable. It has attractive raspberry fruit and lively acidity, while the structure evolves slowly to show the dry edge of tannins and smoky aftertaste. For drinking now and over 4–5 years."
France,Burgundy,Manuel Olivier 2008  Clos de Vougeot,Pinot Noir,88,100.0,"While there are plenty of firm tannins and weight here, the wine does feel somewhat hollow. The red fruits are there, showing slowly against the tannins. It has fine final acidity, but not the power and concentration you should expect."
France,Southwest France,Château Lagrézette 1997 Red (Cahors),Red Blend,87,20.0,"Impressive dark purple in color, this powerful vin carries lots of toasted-oak aromas: menthol and cedar in particular. There's some promising dark fruit underneath it all that should emerge in a couple years' time. Less exciting than this winery's 1996, which leads to the question: could the creation of a luxury cuvée have had an effect on the quality of this wine?"
France,Burgundy,Pierre André 2007 Corton les Renardes Grand Cru  (Corton),Pinot Noir,93,140.0,"Juicy red fruits are the veneer on a wine that is structured and complex, full of tight tannins, intense acidity and the promise of a long-term future. The dry center of the wine holds the exuberant fruit flavors together, while the aftertaste is all freshness."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Faiveley 2009 Les Damodes Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,93,90.0,"A beautifully ripe wine, with the new wood just a hint in the background. The wine has rich red plums and black cherries, laced with the most intense acidity. It is a dense, firmly concentrated wine with a long ahead."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Fribourg 2015  Coteaux Bourguignons,Pinot Noir,85,13.0,"This is a light and fruity wine with red-currant fruit and a crisp texture. Coteaux Bourguignons is one of the Burgundy regional appellations that offers, as here, bright fruity wines that are ready to drink young."
France,Burgundy,Jean-Claude Boisset 2009 Les Charbonnières  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,89,51.0,"This is finely structured, with its ripe tannins forming a solid base for the dense red fruit and spicy wood flavors. It's soli and chunky, showing its youth through the rich texture. Age for 3–4 years."
France,Burgundy,Louis Latour 2010  Chambolle-Musigny,Pinot Noir,89,80.0,"Firm from the start, the wine then shows both ripe red-berry fruit and a dense structure. There's an herbal edge that will soften in the next 2–3 years, bringing out the richness of Chambolle."
France,Burgundy,Louis Latour 2010 Ile de Vergelesses Premier Cru  (Pernand-Vergelesses),Pinot Noir,89,35.0,"Soft and rounded, this has an open, fragrant character. It has ripe flavors of strawberries and red plums, with a touch of wood and delicious, fresh acidity. Only on the finish does the structured side show through."
France,Burgundy,Evening Land 2011 Château de Bligny Premier Cru  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,91,65.0,"An intense and fresh wine that is packed with acidity as well as powerful red fruits. It is breathtakingly fruity at this stage, the structure still developing and giving a delicious perfumed berry character. Drink from 2015."
France,Burgundy,Joseph Drouhin 2009  Côte de Beaune,Pinot Noir,90,34.0,"One of the classic wines from Drouhin, this concentrated and ripe wine has rich tannins, certainly laced with wood. Plum and red-fruit flavors are a delicious presence to go with the firm, solid structure. Age for 3–4 years."
France,Burgundy,Joseph Drouhin 2009  Chorey-lès-Beaune,Pinot Noir,89,25.0,"From its situation on the plain outside Beaune, Chorey is often overlooked. A wine like this, ripe and smooth, full of red fruit, offers a deliciously juicy drink and represents a great value in red Burgundy. Drink now, or keep for two years."
France,Burgundy,Moillard 2009 Les Saint-Georges Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,89,120.0,"A firm, darkly structured wine. It has a hard edge of smoky wood tannins that dominate the black fruits, so it needs 2–3 years to balance out. It's always likely to be a firm, dense wine."
France,Loire Valley,François Millet 2011 Tentation Rouge  (Sancerre),Pinot Noir,88,35.0,"With very herbal aromas, this wood-aged red has a green quality that detracts from the riper red fruit flavors. Acidity and firm tannins do add structure. It needs time to fully integrate, so drink from 2015."
France,Burgundy,Louis Jadot 2013 Les Cazetiers Premier Cru  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,93,135.0,"Rich, juicy and packed with both wood flavors and delicious red fruits, this concentrated and dense wine has a wonderful sense of freshness. There is a strong mineral texture, with tannins that come from ripe fruit as well as wood. The whole wine is finished with acidity, spice and a full-bodied, rich aftertaste."
France,Burgundy,Louis Jadot 2013 Petite Chapelle Premier Cru  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,93,122.0,"With big, ripe fruits, this powerful wine oozes rich plum and spice flavors. It is dark and intense, concentrated with both acidity and wood aging. A line of freshness gives this dense wine an impressive lift of raspberry and red currant flavors. Drink from 2021."
France,Burgundy,Louis Max 2013 Clos Prieur Premier Cru  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,93,160.0,"From a vineyard that lies just beneath the Grand Cru vineyards of Gevrey-Chambertin, this is a well-structured wine. It has a smoky character from the wood aging, giving complexity to the red fruits and dense texture. The acidity of the vintage shows strongly, giving a fruity aftertaste. Drink from 2020."
France,Alsace,Kuentz-Bas 2013 Collection Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,86,29.0,"Soft notes of earth and gentle red fruit appear on the nose. The palate is very soft, smooth and centers on autumnal earthiness rather than fruit. Its pleasing backbone of freshness gives direction to the softness."
France,Alsace,Allimant-Laugner 2014 Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,86,18.0,"A faint scent of red cherry greets the nose and also makes a brief appearance on the fresh, clean and rather light body. This is slightly rustic but is honest and straightforward. Drink soon."
France,Burgundy,Louis Latour 2010  Marsannay,Pinot Noir,86,25.0,"This is fruity, with some structure and pure acidity. It's fragrant and delicious now, bearing raspberry fruit and a light texture."
France,Burgundy,Michel Picard 2009 Le Charmois Premier Cru  (Saint-Aubin),Pinot Noir,86,30.0,"Still tannic, this is a minerally wine that's driven by red currant fruit. Its acidity is also an important element. It has the potential to round out and fill out over the next 2–3 years."
France,Alsace,Cave de Hunawihr 2016 Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,86,20.0,"This is a very easy light-bodied red for chilling. The body is dry, slender and fresh. The flavor expression is of red fruit, earth and apple skin. It has a rustic, picnic-style quality. Drink soon."
France,Burgundy,Louis Latour 2015 Les Damodes Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,92,105.0,"A big firmly structured wine with solid tannins and black-plum-skin texture, the wine is rich and dense. Its fruits are balanced by the concentrated tannins and by the sense of restrained power. Drink from 2023."
France,Burgundy,Château de Santenay 2015 Les Crêts Premier Cru  (Mercurey),Pinot Noir,92,45.0,"Firm and structured, this is a solid wine that will take time to mature. The vineyard, backed by woods, is considered one of the top premier crus in Mercurey. Certainly, this wine with its solid tannins and wood flavors that are backed by acidity and red-berry fruits, is one with a serious future. Drink from 2021."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Pascal Prunier-Bonheur 2015 Les Sizies Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,92,150.0,"Crisp, juicy and fruity, this is a wine that has red-currant flavors under the tannic structure. It is a delicious wine that is light, fruity and likely to age quickly. Drink from 2023."
France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot 2014 Sécret de la Famille  (Bourgogne),Pinot Noir,87,23.0,"This wine is ripe, juicy and packed with fresh red fruits. It has the softest tannins, the whole point being that this wine can be drunk young. The aftertaste brings out acidity. Drink from 2017."
France,Burgundy,Labouré-Roi 2015  Chorey-lès-Beaune,Pinot Noir,87,40.0,"This is a soft, warm wine with ripe red fruit and attractive cherry flavors, its tannins subtly in the background. Open and generous, it's ready to drink."
France,Burgundy,Domaine A. Machard de Gramont 2008 Les Beau Monts  (Chorey-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,88,25.0,"Restrained and elegant, this is a wine on the austere side, its acidity dominant along with a firm, dry aftertaste. Produced by the other Machard de Gramont estate."
France,Burgundy,Maison Champy 2008  Savigny-lès-Beaune,Pinot Noir,88,,"A light-colored, delicate wine that is smooth and soft. It has a good balance of red-cherry flavors, with a little bitterness, layered over some gentle tannins. Not for aging, but attractively juicy now."
France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot 2008 Aux Clous Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,88,,"In a soft and jammy style, packed with red berries and given a plummy juiciness. The structure is here, the fruit hanging on to it, giving the wine a gentle, final feel."
France,Burgundy,Château de Chamirey 2008  Mercurey,Pinot Noir,88,39.0,"A bright, fresh wine, its red currant and fresh plum acidity an important element. It has dry tannins at the core, giving a firm structure and hints of wood, with sweeter fruit coming through to finish."
France,Burgundy,Henri de Villamont 2007 Le Village  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,88,,"Delicious berry fruits, now softening and rounding out, with a light note of acidity. The wine is immediately accessible and attractive, the tannins soft and the fruits edging on sweet."
France,Burgundy,Louis Latour 2008 Les Cazetiers Premier Cru  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,88,120.0,"While there are tannins, they are not as powerful as the appellation and year would suggest. Instead, there is bright acidity, strawberry flavors and a fresh feel."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Jeannin-Naltet 2014 Les Naugues Premier Cru  (Mercurey),Pinot Noir,89,60.0,"With crisp fruit well to the fore, this is a bright, lively wine. Its fruitiness is balanced by firm tannins that lie in the background, lending structure. It should be aged a little longer, so drink from 2018."
France,Southwest France,Domaine de Pellehaut 2015 Harmonie de Gascogne Red (Côtes de Gascogne),Red Blend,85,11.0,"This wine is soft in tannins and bursting exuberant fruit-bomb flavors. It is fresh, obviously young but drinkable as a great summer red."
France,France Other,Bougrier 2016 Alain de la Treille Pinot Noir (Vin de France),Pinot Noir,83,12.0,"While this is soft and fruity, it lacks all varietal resemblance. Drink it as a ripe red rather than as a Pinot Noir."
France,France Other,Patriarche Père et Fils 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Vin de France),Cabernet Sauvignon,82,10.0,"This extracted wine has too hard an edge for the Vin de France category. Softer, more accessible black currant fruit is just hinted at underneath all its structure."
France,France Other,Gabriel Meffre 2016 La Châsse Pinot Noir (Vin de France),Pinot Noir,82,10.0,"This is a thin, fruity, simple wine with some red cherry flavors. Acidity and a touch of tannin completes the picture."
France,France Other,Villebois 2016 Pinot Noir (Vin de France),Pinot Noir,82,12.0,"Spicy with strong toasty flavors, this is a wood-dominated wine. Fleeting glimpses of fruit show behind its barricade of oak-derived flavors. It might soften, but the balance is wrong."
France,Alsace,René Muré 2012 Clos Saint Landelin Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,90,75.0,"This is still a young wine, with its ripe red fruits and black cherry flavors. The taste of licorice mingles with the fruit and balances with the smoky toast flavors. It's a rich wine that needs time, so drink from 2016."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Anne Gros 2006 Le Grand Maupertui  (Clos de Vougeot),Pinot Noir,96,,"A big, structured wine, still young, with a dense, firm character. The wine is solid, with concentrated black fruits that power deep down into the texture, adding their richness to licorice, bitter chocolate and inspired acidity. Age for at least five years."
France,Burgundy,Domaine des Lambrays 2002  Clos de Lambrays,Pinot Noir,95,,"An elegant, charming wine that offers structure as well as finesse. The fruits are delicious, perfumed, just maturing into smoky bacon flavors. Dry tannins and red fruits are balanced by fresh acidity."
France,Burgundy,Clos de Tart 2006  Clos de Tart,Pinot Noir,94,,"This is a classic. Not an enormous wine, but with all the finesse and elegance of great Burgundy. The fruit is vibrant, juicily red, bursting through the gentle tannins. The freshness is mouthwatering and vivid. It is probably not a long aging wine, but in 5 years its freshness and ripeness will be equally enjoyable."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Anne Gros 2006 Les Barreaux  (Vosne-Romanée),Pinot Noir,94,,"With its wonderful, heady aromas of red fruits and sweet jelly, this is already a delicious wine before the first sip. Then the exuberant fruits kick in with flavors of red berries, strawberries and sweet plums. As a balance, there is firm structure, minerality and fine finishing acidity."
France,Burgundy,Chanson Père et Fils 2005 Clos des Fèves Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,94,85.0,"A complete wine that speaks of both richness and terroir. While the tannins are certainly there, they are dominated by rich black fruits, ripeness, power and concentration. It is the sort of wine that reveals many layers of flavor and complexity. Age for five years."
France,Loire Valley,Domaine Vincent Delaporte 2010 Maxime Vieilles Vignes sur Silex  (Sancerre),Pinot Noir,89,42.0,"Fruity wine, wild strawberry flavors that are cut through with juicy acidity. Touches of wood support the soft, ripe tannins of this structured, generous wine. Age for 3–4 years."
France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot 2006 Domaine du Clos Frantin  (Vosne-Romanée),Pinot Noir,88,,"A firm wine that has ripe but structured tannins. It is not a big wine, but rather shows a tighter style of Pinot Noir that balances sweet red fruits and a spice edge of wood. It would benefit from aging for 2–3 years."
France,Burgundy,Chanson Père et Fils 2005  Nuits-St.-Georges,Pinot Noir,88,70.0,"Tense and dark, this has firm, dry tannins that overlay black plum skin and black fig flavors. The wine shows richness but also a foursquare solid structure and weight that is balanced by a final sweet, satisfying juicy acidity."
France,Burgundy,Maison Champy 2006 Vieilles Vignes  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,88,60.0,"Big and burly, here is power from Pinot Noir. The tannins are firm, spiced with dark black fruits, rolling luxuriously around the mouth. A spike of acidity gives the wine some freshness, but it remains a big, plump wine."
France,Southwest France,Château Bellevue la Forêt 2004 Optimum Red (Fronton),Red Blend,90,22.0,"Made from old vines, this is a blend of Syrah and Négrette, with some Cabernet Sauvignon to give extra structure. It has fresh juiciness, with red plum and berry flavors, a touch of sweet chocolate, the wood aging well judged to leave the clarity of the fruit."
France,Burgundy,Louis Latour 2015  Nuits-St.-Georges,Pinot Noir,91,79.0,The wine is structured with solid tannins and a foursquare character. Ripe fruits with plenty of balancing acidity give this wine its density and its crisp edge. This is a fruity wine that will develop slowly and well. Drink from 2020.
France,Champagne,Pierre Gerbais NV L'Audace Brut Nature Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,93,62.0,"With no dosage and no added sulfur dioxide, this wine is bright and tightly crisp, but the ripe Pinot Noir from this southern region of Champagne gives richness. With this good balance, the wine is fresh and generous at the same time. Because it is so dry, a few more months bottle age will make it even better, so wait to drink until 2017."
France,Burgundy,Roux Père et Fils 2009  Côte de Beaune-Villages,Pinot Noir,85,19.0,"A fresh and juicy wine, full of red fruits as well as striking acidity. The tannins are soft, but do offer a core of firm dryness. For aging over the next two years."
France,Burgundy,Tollot Beaut et Fils 2014 Les Lavières Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,90,,"The wood is still showing in this ripe, fruity wine. That's fine because the fruit and the perfumed acidity will fill out the wine and give it richness. Drink from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Manuel Olivier 2012 Les Damaudes  (Vosne-Romanée),Pinot Noir,92,80.0,"Old vines give this single-parcel wine its power and concentration. Long wood aging hasn't diminished the richness of the fruit, the juicy acidity and the succulent berry flavors. It's a wine that's full and structured, likely to age well. Drink from 2018."
France,France Other,Doudet Naudin 2016 Pinot Noir (Vin de France),Pinot Noir,86,15.0,"The Savigny-lès-Beaune-based producer shows his Pinot Noir skills with this wine. It's generous, with red plum flavor, light wood-aging notes, ripe tannins and crisp acidity. It's rounded and ready to drink."
France,Burgundy,Chanson Père et Fils 2013  Nuits-St.-Georges,Pinot Noir,88,77.0,"In this generous interpretation of Nuits Saint-Georges, ripe berry fruits burst through the typical dry tannins. It has plenty of red-fruit flavors, a generous texture and structure. Drink this already attractive wine from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Domaine René Bouvier 2014 Clos du Roy  (Marsannay),Pinot Noir,88,,"Smoky and structured, this is a dry wine with only the acidity to hint at the berry fruits to come. With this firm, toasty tannic character, the wine is likely to remain structured for a while to come. Drink from 2020."
France,Provence,Domaine de Sulauze 2011 Lauze Red (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence),Red Blend,82,30.0,This is a strangely chemical wine that has overripe fruit. It misses out on initial acidity and fruitiness.
France,Southwest France,Domaine Rotier 2005 Les Gravels Red (Gaillac),Red Blend,88,20.0,"Finely balanced wine, layering tannins, red juicy fruits and plenty of delicious, sweet acidity. Like so many Gaillac wines, it has an attractive, earthy edge, which gives character and will blow away as the wine ages. The tannins come back at the end, so the aging potential is good."
France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot 2010 Clos Prieur  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,89,,"This is a smoky, fragrant wine that offers dense fruit and firm tannins. It has the structure of a fine Gevrey and the concentration of the vintage. This is classic and worth aging for 4–5 years."
France,Loire Valley,Domaine Delaporte 2014 Maxime Cuvée Silex  (Sancerre),Pinot Noir,92,,"While the wine is very young, the potential is there. It has rich tannins and berry fruits that are packed with youthful acidity. The structure and the depth of flavor are there with a hint of the juicy fruits as well as the minerality that are both developing. Drink from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot 2014 Domaine Adélie Le Champs-Martin Premier Cru  (Mercurey),Pinot Noir,88,48.0,"This ripe wine offers swathes of red fruits and soft tannins. The structure is well embedded in the juicy red-cherry flavors that are further lifted by acidity. It's an attractive, smooth wine that will be ready from 2017."
France,Burgundy,Au Pied du Mont Chauve 2013 Clos des Fietres  (Corton),Pinot Noir,94,140.0,"Close to the village of Aloxe-Corton, this vineyard is one of the smallest of the Corton grand crus. This wine, still fresh while also closed up with tannins, is dark, structured and has the potential to age many years. Intense red-berry acidity and a tight, dry core still convey youthfulness. Drink this impressive wine from 2022."
France,Burgundy,Manuel Olivier 2009  Aloxe-Corton,Pinot Noir,88,,"Intense and concentrated, this shows dense tannins and layers of red- and black-fruit flavors, with the acidity cutting through. It's likely to age well over 4–5 years."
France,Burgundy,Roux Père et Fils 2010 Montée Rouge  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,88,,This has a firm tannic structure that's allied to a smoky character. The dry core is bold and offers a counterpoint to the ripe red- and black-plum fruit. For aging over 4–5 years.
France,Burgundy,Olivier Leflaive 2010 Clos des Angles Premier Cru  (Volnay),Pinot Noir,91,90.0,"Big and firm, this is packed with red fruits and solid tannins. It has flavors of red berries and black fruits—the wood component still prominent. The acidity is gentle; but it does need to age for at least four years."
France,Burgundy,Château Philippe-le-Hardi 2010 Les Brunettes et Planchots  (Aloxe-Corton),Pinot Noir,91,,"Complex, dense and structured, this has dark plum fruit and solid, integrated tannins. It has weight and richness, finishing with crisp red-berry acidity."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Jean Monnier et Fils 2010  Volnay,Pinot Noir,91,43.0,"Ripe and full, this tempers the natural richness of Volnay with the restraint of tannins and layers of wood. The red fruit flavors are given a boost by the young acidity that needs time to calm down. Age for 3–4 years."
France,Burgundy,Domaines Devillard 2010 Domaine des Perdrix  (Vosne-Romanée),Pinot Noir,91,75.0,"This demonstrates the complexity of firm and concentrated Vosne-Romanée, with a generous, fruity character. It shows its structure first, followed by beautiful red fruits. Age for 4–5 years or more."
France,Burgundy,Joseph Drouhin 2010 Clos de Godeaux Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,90,35.0,"Floral and round, this pushes its red berry flavors forward. It's so elegant and perfumed, with an attractive structure and acidity. Ready to drink in a few months."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Bart 2014 Les Echezots  (Marsannay),Pinot Noir,88,,"This is a fresh, juicy wine with acidity and bright red fruits. Yes, there are tannins but they support the lively, crisp strawberries and the spice that comes from the wood aging. The wine is developing fast and will be ready to drink from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Collotte 2014 Champ Salomon  (Marsannay),Pinot Noir,88,,"This is tight, tannic and offers red-currant fruits. It has a dusty texture along with layers of acidity, spice and hints of wood aging. The wine is fresh with bright fruitiness and good acidity. The tannins do suggest aging potential, so don't drink before 2019."
France,Burgundy,Labouré-Roi 2014  Savigny-lès-Beaune,Pinot Noir,88,25.0,"Typically soft and ripe, this is already a delicious, fruity wine. It is strongly perfumed and has the acidity typical of the vintage. Ripe red fruits and acidity are well balanced, with dry tannins that are still in the background. Drink the wine from 2018."
France,Alsace,Vignoble des 2 Lunes 2013 Poussière d'Etoiles Rosé Zéro Dosage Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,90,20.0,"While this is pink fizz, its intent is serious and showcases the structure of Pinot Noir. The palate is dry and displays some pleasant bitterness around the edges, accentuating both dryness and austerity. This will work better at the table—say with salmon sashimi—rather than as an apéritif. This is a serious wine, so explore its hidden charms."
France,Champagne,Mailly Grand Cru NV Blanc de Noirs Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,92,50.0,"Pure Pinot Noir, an unusual style, gives a powerful rich character to a wine. This ripe, dense and full-bodied Champagne is full of apricot, pear and green plum flavors that are linked with the tight, lightly tannic texture. It is a well-balanced wine, ready to drink."
France,Southwest France,Château Lagrézette 2013 Red (Cahors),Red Blend,93,45.0,"This is a bold wine in all senses. It is packed with fruit, dry tannins and a dense texture from vines planted not long after Alain Dominique Perrin began Lagrézette's restoration in the '80s. The blend of 87% Malbec, 12% Merlot and 1% Tannat presents powerful tannins and generous fruitiness. This estate wine will be slow to develop and to reveal its full ripe potential, so drink after 2020."
France,Burgundy,Louis Max 2009 Domaine de la Créa Les Cent Vignes Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,88,41.0,"Raspberry ripeness and soft tannins lend warmth to this structured wine. It has weight and a smoky wood character, with a juicy finish. Age for 2–3 years."
France,Burgundy,Domaines Devillard 2010 Clos du Cellier aux Moines Premier Cru  (Givry),Pinot Noir,88,40.0,"On the rustic side, this fruity wine has rhubarb and red fruit flavors, with intense acidity and a pure, juicy core. The soft tannins just underpin the fruity character. Age for two years, although it's ready to drink now."
France,Burgundy,Roche de Bellene 2011 Vieilles Vignes  (Volnay),Pinot Noir,90,64.0,"A fruity, fragrant wine, it has a light structure, soft tannins and generous, juicy red berry fruits. The balanced touch of wood aging smoothes out some of the sharp corners. Drink this attractive wine from 2016."
France,Burgundy,Domaine des Perdrix 2008  Nuits-St.-Georges,Pinot Noir,88,86.0,"A beautifully perfumed wine. It has a good edge of firm tannins, but the fruit is so sweet and ripe, packed with strawberry jam flavors. Very seductive, the wood spice gives an extra edge. Drink now, or age for 4–5 years."
France,Burgundy,Henri de Villamont 2007  Chambolle-Musigny,Pinot Noir,88,,"An attractive, ripe strawberry-flavored wine, with bright acidity combined with sweetness. It is already ready to drink, soft, full-bodied, stylish."
France,Burgundy,Henri de Villamont 2008 Clos des Guettes  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,88,,"Tight, mineral and closed, packed with dark tannins. The fruit lies behind all this texture, leaving an impression of toughness, the acidity dominant."
France,Burgundy,Henri de Villamont 2008 Le Village  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,88,,"Attractive, luscious fruits are balanced by acidity and tannins. There is just a hint of green, and the black currant and mineral texture give a chewy, firm aftertaste."
France,Loire Valley,Henri Bourgeois 2009 Domaine Gérard Fiou  (Sancerre),Pinot Noir,87,,"This is a ripe, wood laden wine. It has red plum and damson flavors overladen by notes of burnt toast and smoke. Acidity shows through on the finish."
France,Burgundy,Simonnet-Febvre 2009 Bourgogne Pinot Noir  (Bourgogne),Pinot Noir,84,16.0,"This lightweight red is on the herbal side, although with attractive bitter-cherry flavors and some fresh acidity."
France,Alsace,Domaine Charles Frey 2013 Harmonie Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,83,35.0,"This wine offers red berry fruits, the softest tannins and texture and an earthy, rustic aftertaste. Drink now."
France,Southwest France,Lionel Osmin & Cie 2010 Donibane Red (Irrouléguy),Red Blend,88,24.0,"A blend of Cabernet Franc and Tannat, this is spicy, smoky and herbal. It is dense, with a green, stalky edge that comes from the acidity and black tannins. Age for two years."
France,Burgundy,Domaine des Croix 2014 Les Bressandes Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,93,61.0,"From one of the top Beaune premier-cru vineyards, this wine is dark and dense with hints of wood as well as chocolate. To balance this, the ripe berry fruit is right there, deliciously fresh and with a tight line of acidity. A wine with a future, it is not ready to drink before 2020."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Jean Grivot 2013 Roncières Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,93,,"Smooth and supple, this wine has structure and tannin so well cushioned by the ripe fruits and fine acidity. The structure and tannins are integrated into the rich red fruits and dark plum juiciness. The aftertaste, with an elegant freshness, brings the balance together. Drink from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Henri de Villamont 2012 Petite Chapelle Premier Cru  (Gevrey-Chambertin),Pinot Noir,93,,"This wine has all the tannins you would expect from Gevry, although with some suppleness. They are surrounded by ripe red berry fruits, a rich texture of spice and delicious, refreshing acidity. It's a dense wine, complex and worth aging. Drink from 2018."
France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot 2014 Château Gris Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,93,120.0,"This is a premier cru with a single owner, described as a Monopole in French. It has ripe tannins backed with hints of smokiness. The fruit lies behind the structure, with its powerful, dense character. Hints of the juicy, black-fruit future of this wine come through the texture. Drink from 2022."
France,Burgundy,Chanson Père et Fils 2013 Clos du Roi Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,93,68.0,"This is a firm wine, full of tannins as well as plenty of ripe berries. It is concentrated, juicy and perfumed, an attractive wine already. The dry core gives structure to this panoply of fruitiness. The name comes from French king Louis XI who acquired the vineyard in the 15th century."
France,Burgundy,Chanson Père et Fils 2013 Teurons Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,93,69.0,"Rich in character, this is a dense wine, with smoky tannins and juicy red fruits that are deliciously ripe.

France,Burgundy,Domaine Faiveley 2014 Les Porêts-Saint-Georges Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,93,113.0,"Firm and structured, this wine offers dark tannins and concentration. It has the acidity of the year but with a solid texture. There are hints of the perfume and the delicious fruit to come, but they will take time to show. Don't drink this wine with its potential before 2022."
France,Burgundy,Domaines Devillard 2014 Domaine de la Ferté Clos de Mortières  (Givry),Pinot Noir,88,40.0,"This small vineyard is right on the edge of the village of Givry.

France,Burgundy,Jaffelin 2010 Sur les Grèves Clos Saint-Anne Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,91,57.0,"This has firm tannins, and it demonstrates the potential of its juicy fruit flavors. With its powerful structure, this is a slowly developing selection that needs at least five years in a cellar."
France,Burgundy,Joseph Drouhin 2010 Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny),Pinot Noir,91,90.0,"A blend of wines from a number of Chambolle's premier cru vineyards, this is a rich and generous wine, with spice and red berry flavors, plus sweet tannins and a firm feel on the finish."
France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot 2010 Clos des Maréchaudes Premier Cru  (Aloxe-Corton),Pinot Noir,91,,This Bichot monopole has produced a round wine that's full of attractive plum flavor. It's backbone is buried in the sumptuous texture. Age this for at least four years.
France,Burgundy,Louis Jadot 2010 Theurons Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,91,70.0,"Perfumed, rich yet soft, this is opulent Beaune at its best. It has acidity and a touch of tannin, but it's the broad, ripe red-fruit flavors that dominate, which gives juiciness and vitality to this wine that will age for several years."
France,Burgundy,Olivier Leflaive 2010 Mitans Premier Cru  (Volnay),Pinot Noir,91,,"Mitans is one of the lesser-known premier crus in Volnay, and it has created a wine that shows the voluptuousness of Volnay. It has a smoky character, and it's laced with acidity and bright red fruit. It will benefit from 3–4 years of aging."
France,Southwest France,Alain Brumont 2009 Château Bouscassé Red (Madiran),Red Blend,94,20.0,"Bouscassé is the home estate of Alain Brumont, who also owns Château Montus.

France,Burgundy,Chanson Père et Fils 2005 Les Vergelesses Premier Cru  (Pernand-Vergelesses),Pinot Noir,92,65.0,"Rich fruit, layered with acidity, stars in a wine that is dense, very much a product of the powerful 2005 vintage. With the concentrated tannins, this is showing that it needs to age, but already the sweet fruits are opulent and soft."
France,Burgundy,Bouchard Père & Fils 2006 Marconnets Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,92,55.0,"Firm and tense, this is a wine on the high wire. The tannins are stretched with acidity, the berry fruits and red cherry flavors vividly standing out against this structure. The aftertaste is fine, poised, mineral. This is developing into an important wine."
France,Burgundy,Chanson Père et Fils 2005 Les Boudots Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,92,125.0,"Dense, concentrated, solid, this wine shows the stern side of Nuits-Saint-Georges. The tannins are dry, very firm and rough at the edges. The fruit is just as edgy, with black, juicy plums surrounded by smoky wood and tobacco. The wine needs to age, although it will always have a solid, structured character."
France,Burgundy,Maison Champy 2006  Corton,Pinot Noir,92,96.0,"In its early stages of evolution, this wine offers mainly stoniness, firm acidity and a hard- edged structure. Of course it will soften, but this will likely remain a tannic wine, the fruit always edged with acidity, for many years. It is potentially a great wine that just needs patience."
France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot 2006 Clos des Maréchaudes  (Corton),Pinot Noir,92,,"A finely perfumed wine, but one with a tight initial structure. Ripe wild strawberries and mulberries appear with dry tannins and spice from wood. The finish underlines that this is a wine for aging, with its structure and firmness. Keep for 4–5 years."
France,Burgundy,Albert Bichot 2006 Domaine du Clos Frantin  (Clos de Vougeot),Pinot Noir,92,,"From parcels in the southern portion of Clos Vougeot, Bichot produces a ripe, relatively soft style of wine.

France,Burgundy,Domaine Jayer-Gilles 2006 Les Hauts Poirets  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,92,149.0,"This shows the proper attention to structure that is the inheritance of any Nuits-Saint-Georges. But around that structure, Gilles Jayer builds a velvet curtain of ripe black fruits, touched with spice and leavened with acidity. It's a wine that is delicious now, but certainly should be aged."
France,Burgundy,Maison Champy 2006 Les Suchots Premier Cru  (Vosne-Romanée),Pinot Noir,92,100.0,"A lively, fresh wine that gives joy, with its delicious sweet red fruits. It fills the mouth with freshness, as well as showing some tense tannins. The aftertaste continues this vibrant theme, with sweet acidity and ripe fruit."
France,Burgundy,Maison Champy 2006 Taillepieds Premier Cru  (Volnay),Pinot Noir,92,,"Smoky, delicious, ripe fruit dominates this luscious wine. It sings of rich strawberries, given structure with minerality and sweet tannins. Immediately appealing, the structure does promise some aging."
France,Burgundy,Bouchard Père & Fils 2006 Aux Malconsorts Premier Cru  (Vosne-Romanée),Pinot Noir,92,160.0,"From its privileged position right next to the grand cru of La Tâche, Aux Malconsorts has produced a heady, perfumed wine, relatively delicate, relying on its succulent red fruits to give body. It is on the sweet side of Pinot Noir, jammy with red berry flavors, and already delicious."
France,Rhône Valley,Vignobles Boudinaud 2008 Côté Jardin Red (Côtes du Rhône),Red Blend,84,12.0,"Less successful than some previous bottlings under this label, the 2008 seems earthier and less fruit-forward, with coffee and tree bark notes dominating this medium-bodied wine. The blend is 55% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 15% Mourvèdre."

France,Burgundy,Louis Max 2009  Chambolle-Musigny,Pinot Noir,87,58.0,"The Louis Max style seems to be of wines that open slowly and have a firm structure. That's the case here: It has plenty of acidity, with a red currant flavor and a dry, dense character."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Chantal Lescure 2011 Le Clos des Topes Bizot  (Côte de Beaune),Pinot Noir,87,,"This fresh wine is vinified in tanks rather than wood to retain the bright strawberry fruit flavors. It is elegant, light and has good acidity. Drink now."

France,Burgundy,Henri de Villamont 2015 Clos des Guettes Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,92,,"While there are wood aromas and wood flavors, the wine is equally about ripe fruit and generous tannins.

France,Burgundy,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2015 Les Arvelets Premier Cru  (Pommard),Pinot Noir,92,103.0,"This is firm, in the Pommard style.

France,Burgundy,Domaine Arnoux Père et Fils 2014 Les Beaumonts  (Chorey-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,88,35.0,"Aged in wood, this wine is ripe, with a smoky character from the toastiness.

It will be ready to drink from 2018."
France,France Other,Vignobles Brumont 2009 Le Pinot Noir d'Alain Brumont Pinot Noir (Vin de France),Pinot Noir,88,40.0,"Very recognisably Pinot Noir, even if not Burgundian, this is an earthy wine that is full of spice and secondary, mature flavors.

France,Burgundy,Dujac Fils & Pere 2009  Morey-Saint-Denis,Pinot Noir,90,76.0,"Structured and dense, with layered tannins and an austere edge. At the same time, the fruit packs concentrated strawberry flavors, acidity and complexities from textured wood."
France,Burgundy,Jean-Claude Boisset 2009  Echézeaux,Pinot Noir,93,179.0,"In this vintage, Echézeaux reveals an extra edge of really ripe, full fruits.

France,Alsace,Domaine Saint-Rémy 2014 Rosenberg Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,88,23.0,Aromatic red berries signal tart pleasure: redcurrant and raspberry. The very easy and smooth body fully plays into that with light-bodied charm. Drink while the aromas still sing.

France,Champagne,Devaux NV Blanc de Noirs Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,91,45.0,"As befits a 100% Pinot Noir wine, this is a rich Champagne, poised between ripe apricot and pear fruits and more mineral acidity. Just a touch of tannin adds structure to this ready-to-drink wine."
France,Champagne,Drappier NV Brut Nature Zero Dosage Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,91,57.0,"This dry Champagne forms a good contrast with the Brut Nature Rosé from the same producer.

France,Burgundy,Chanson Père et Fils 2005 Clos du Roi Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,92,65.0,"The first mouthful reveals a wine that is just plain opulent and rich.

France,Burgundy,Chanson Père et Fils 2005 Epenots Premier Cru  (Pommard),Pinot Noir,92,95.0,"Solid and concentrated, this wine initially is tight, showing minerality as well as rich fruit.

France,Burgundy,Maison Champy 2006 Grands Epenots Premier Cru  (Pommard),Pinot Noir,91,85.0,"Big, tannic and foursquare, this is archetypal Pommard.

Machard de Gramont 2014 Aux Guettes Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,90,35.0,"High-toast aromas from the wood aging are followed on the palate by more layers of toast and spice.

France,Burgundy,Domaine Michel Lafarge 2006 Clos des Chênes Premier Cru  (Volnay),Pinot Noir,95,,"Tannic and structured, chunky in style and texture.

Age for another six years."

France,Burgundy,Henri de Villamont 2008 Les Roncerets Premier Cru  (Volnay),Pinot Noir,91,,"There is a rich texture, with black and red cherry fruits. The wine is dominated more by the dark and complex tannins that give a solid and firm base, and also show potential lusciousness."
France,Burgundy,Bailly-Lapierre NV Pinot Noir Brut  (Crémant de Bourgogne),Pinot Noir,91,24.0,"Bailly Lapierre regards this full-bodied rich Pinot Noir as its signature wine. It has a cool, northern feel to it, but it also has powerful red-berry fruits, a firm structure, a final layer of acidity and a sense this is a wine as well as a Crémant."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Pierre Labet 2013 Clos du Dessus des Marconnets  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,90,75.0,"While it is not a premier cru, this wine conveys many of the precise red-fruit flavors of the Les Marconnets vineyard just below on the slope. It is finely perfumed, with the softness typical of the northern Beaune vineyards. Vivid strawberry and red-cherry fruits are already delicious and ready to drink."
France,Burgundy,Domaine de Bellene 2011 Vieilles Vignes  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,89,100.0,There is as much fruit as structure in this wine. Ripe red fruits are supported by solid tannins while pushing out fragrant acidity. It has structure while also allowing room for final fruitiness.
France,Burgundy,Maison Champy 2011  Marsannay,Pinot Noir,87,,"Attractive red fruits and freshness combine to produce a lively, elegant wine with a light structure and complete fruitiness. Drink from 2017."
France,Southwest France,Château Bellevue la Forêt 2011 Optimum Red (Fronton),Red Blend,92,39.0,"A dark colored blend of Négrette and Syrah, this is a concentrated and perfumed wine from Philip Grant, an Irishman who bought the estate in 2008. It is full of ripe plum fruits and bold tannins that give shape to what is a super-rich wine. The wood aging has cast a smooth patina over the fruit and given an extra complexity. This fine wine is ready to drink."
France,Southwest France,Famille Laplace 2014 Domaine Mouréou Red (Madiran),Red Blend,91,16.0,"One of several properties owned by the Laplace family, this estate has produced a ripe, juicy and generously tannic wine. It has luscious acidity as well as bold black-currant fruit. With some dark tannins and a firm structure, it can age. Drink starting from 2018."
France,Southwest France,Domaine de Laballe 2015 Les Terres Basses Red (Côtes de Gascogne),Red Blend,85,,"Light, fruity and with attractive red fruits, this is a crisp wine. It has cool tannins and bold acidity. With a juicy aftertaste, the wine is ready to drink."
France,Southwest France,Château d'Aydie 2006 Aramis Tannat Cabernet Red (Vin de Pays du Comté Tolosan),Red Blend,86,9.0,"Named after one of the Three Musketeers, this is a simple, rounded but dense wine, with hints of dry fruit topped by rounded, soft, black flavors. A great value, it has open flavors with spice and a juicy, smoky aftertaste."
France,Loire Valley,Domaine Joël Delaunay 2012 Domaine de la Brossette Red (Touraine),Red Blend,87,18.0,"This blend of Cabernet Franc and Gamay concentrates on fruit and soft acidity. It has some smokiness and rounded tannins, fresh and full of red fruits. It is ready to drink."
France,Burgundy,Bouchard Aîné & Fils 2005 Les Peuillets Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,85,36.0,"Bitter black cherries are the hallmark of this rather hard-edged wine. It shows dark tannins and fruit that misses full richness. Maybe it is restrained power, maybe it will age, but the balance is not there now."
France,Alsace,Joseph Cattin NV Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,88,25.0,"Strawberry compote on the nose leads to a berry-fruited palate with slightly more tartness: cranberry and red currant come to mind. The flavours are ultrafresh and invigorating, made even more so by the lively frothy fizz. This is joyful, fresh and generous. Drink soon."
France,Champagne,Vollereaux NV Brut Rosé de Saignée Pinot Noir (Champagne),Pinot Noir,88,40.0,"Most rosé Champagnes get their color by the addition of red wine. This wine gets its hue from the skins of red grapes macerating before fermentation. It has a deep pink color and a lightly tannic character, making for a rich wine flavored with red currants and finished with acidity."
France,Loire Valley,Domaine Jean-Paul Balland 2014  Sancerre,Pinot Noir,90,21.0,"This ripe and full-bodied wine has weight as well as fine fruits. It is juicy, still fresh with its acidity and still structured. Aging for 12 months in large barrels has given an extra richness as well as broadening the fruitiness. Drink from 2019."
France,Burgundy,Tollot Beaut et Fils 2014 Les Grèves Premier Cru  (Beaune),Pinot Noir,93,100.0,"A perfumed wine with red fruits, this offers dry tannins and a dense texture. With all these elements in place, the wine will develop slowly and well. Drink from 2021."
France,Burgundy,Jaffelin 2014 Les Vergelesses Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),Pinot Noir,93,49.0,"This will be a delicious, ripe and full wine.

France,Burgundy,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2014  Corton Vergennes,Pinot Noir,93,170.0,"With spice and layers of wood aging over the black-cherry fruit, this is a wine in progress. It has the bright character of the vintage, full of acidity and with the potential of great fruitiness. From the Vergennes sub-section of the Corton Grand Cru, it has a good future. Drink from 2021."
France,Burgundy,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2014 Les Damodes Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,93,101.0,"A level portion of this premier cru, called Les Plateaux, is the origin of this wine. As befits a wine from Nuits Saint-Georges, it is dark with tannins as well as fruit. It has a good structure, with dense blackberry and plum flavors that are developing. Give this wine until 2022."
France,Alsace,René Muré 2011 Côte de Rouffach Pinot Noir (Alsace),Pinot Noir,87,,"Soft, fragrant wine, layering raspberry and red currant fruit with elegant tannins and acidity. The wood aging shows lightly, giving a wine that is fruity and ripe. Drink from 2014."
France,Burgundy,Château Philippe-le-Hardi 2010 Les Puillets Premier Cru  (Mercurey),Pinot Noir,89,34.0,"This has a firm edge of tannins along with dense red fruits. It's structured and balanced, with the texture and acidity that suggest its aging potential. Give this 3–4 years."
France,Burgundy,Domaine Poulleau Père et Fils 2010  Volnay,Pinot Noir,89,,"Soft, round and perfumed, this has rich red fruits that are laced with youthful acids and tannins. With its texture, it has good aging potential; give it 4–5 years."
France,Burgundy,Roux Père et Fils 2008 Les Borniques  (Chambolle-Musigny),Pinot Noir,89,100.0,"A tight, tannic wine, showing considerable acidity as well as fresh red fruits. The wine is densely packed with dry tannins, then a fruity character develops, sparked by acidity."
France,Burgundy,Simonnet-Febvre 2007  Crémant de Bourgogne,Pinot Noir,89,25.0,"Crisp sparkling Burgundy, laced with taut acidity and hints of nuts and toast. This is a wine under tension, with a strong mineral element, cool and fresh, best with food."
France,Burgundy,Joseph Drouhin 2008  Chambolle-Musigny,Pinot Noir,89,62.0,"Pure, ripe strawberry flavors are pierced with acidity. The texture is soft, with a dry side. The raspberry acidity cuts right to the end."
France,Burgundy,Louis Latour 2009 En Chevret  (Volnay),Pinot Noir,89,65.0,"Soft, ripe and rich, this is very easy on the palate. The wine does have good depth of flavor from the rounded black cherry flavors, the fruit almost sweet in its openness. It is already delicious."
France,Burgundy,Louis Latour 2009 Les Damodes  (Nuits-St.-Georges),Pinot Noir,89,115.0,"Concentrated, with dark tannins to go with the ripe fruit. There is a tough edge to the wine, although it is more accessible than some Nuits-Saint-Georges at this stage."
France,Burgundy,Camille Giroud 2008  Côte de Beaune-Villages,Pinot Noir,88,30.0,"A fresh, juicy wine, with attractive acidity, red berry flavors and a layer of well balanced tannins. Very perfumed, with hints of mineral and final acidity."
France,Burgundy,Henri de Villamont 2005  Grands-Echezeaux,Pinot Noir,91,107.0,"A powerful, chunky wine, packed with solid tannins that promise good aging. It has a sense of drama in its spice, dark tannins and spacious fruit. This is going to develop well over 5–10 years."
France,Burgundy,Bouchard Père & Fils 2005 Premier Cru  (Pommard),Pinot Noir,91,66.0,"A blend from several premier cru vineyards in Pommard, here is a wine that exhibits just the right firm but dusty tannins of the appellation. But because it is 2005, the natural exuberance of the fruit is also there, lively red berries under the dry structure. It needs some aging, but already the richness is there, along with a smoky aftertaste."
