Italy,Central Italy,Lamoretti 2006 Vinnalunga Red (Emilia-Romagna),Red Blend,88,32.0,You can feel how this wine attempts greatness both in the thickness of the extraction and the intensity of the aromas.

Italy,Southern Italy,Candido 1997 Riserva Red (Salice Salentino),Red Blend,84,8.0,"Emanating from the heel of the Italian boot, close to the beautiful city of Lecce, this is one of Puglia’s classic wines. The grapes are Negroamaro and Malvasia Nera. Pleasant cherry-berry aromas and flavors predominate. The structure is ample, as is the mouthfeel. The tannins need some softening. The finish is long.

Italy,Veneto,Remo Farina 1997 Ripasso  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore),Red Blend,82,12.0,"The ripasso technique consists of passing the already completed “normal” Valpolicella back over the lees of the Amarone in the spring after vinification of the latter is complete. This results in a minor refermentation, adding extra alcohol and flavor. If the latter occurred in this particular version, it is not very evident. There is a modest amount of dry fruit present, but the mouth-searing acids and mouth-drying tannins hurt this wine."
Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Vivera 2010 Martinella  (Etna),Red Blend,89,35.0,"Made with 80% Nerello Mascalese and 20% Nerello Cappuccio, this opens with aromas of black fruit, subtle oak, toast and vanilla.
